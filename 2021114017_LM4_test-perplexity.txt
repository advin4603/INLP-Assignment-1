providential you came on the scene .	1.5897226549917274

corny kelleher laughs , pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding .	5.6991618299193805
two commercials that were standing fizz in jammet’s .	1.129002147317274
like princes , faith .	1.3987106241853224
one of them lost two quid on the race .	2.4848389885834643

the horse neighs .	1.3966331459318944
the horse hohohohohohoh !	1.027454835240721
hohohohome !	1
corny kelleher sure it was behan our jarvey there that told me after we left the two commercials in mrs cohen’s and i told him to pull up and got off to see .	11.437939675758589

burying the dead .	1.3847347205993437
safe home !	1
the horse neighs .	1.3966331459318944
hohohohohome .	1
bloom good night .	1.3791443847481377
i’ll just wait and take him along in a few.. .	1.4919640287812992
corny kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it .	2.1501781200747665
the horse harness jingles .	1.2106471967301007
corny kelleher from the car , standing .	1.8007296005132791
night .	1
bloom night .	1
the jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly .	2.694185349158354
the car and horse back slowly , awkwardly , and turn .	1.649821018929301
corny kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at bloom’s plight .	4.264181788164607
the jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat .	2.9532270295835756
bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply .	1.6160482349007814
with thumb and palm corny kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done .	3.8965663927998144
with a slow nod bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what stephen needs .	1.2999498304840285
the car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane .	4.247321618112613
corny kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand .	1.5770094022424699
bloom with his hand assuralooms corny kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay .	2.006813869321846
the tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay .	1.4808413941354688
bloom , holding in his hand stephen’s hat , festooned with shavings , and ashplant , stands irresolute .	3.0014326937321014
then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder .	2.8116194677022923
bloom eh !	1
ho !	1
there is no answer ; he bends again .	1.4562877610866296
mr dedalus !	1
there is no answer .	1.414268922193691
the name if you call .	1.3463638376449016
somnambulist .	1
he bends again and , hesitating , brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form .	4.657629878898527
stephen !	1
there is no answer .	1.414268922193691
he calls again .	1.419521657009559

stephen groans .	1

he turns on his left side , sighing , doubling himself together .	3.042719396547605
bloom poetry .	1
well educated .	1

he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephen’s waistcoat .	2.608859530154456
to breathe .	1
he brushes the woodshavings from stephen’s clothes with light hand and fingers .	1.5958115333034868

bloom , holding the hat and ashplant , stands erect .	2.926864972697997
a dog barks in the distance .	1.5208543217569541
bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant .	1.7124179074924426
he looks down on stephen’s face and form .	2.1956456463811476
bloom communes with the night .	1.7295072979857897
face reminds me of his poor mother .	1.7608957653502655

where the tide ebbs.. .	1.2106330403646142

silent , thoughtful , alert he stands on guard , his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master .	3.6609074312313825
against the dark wall a figure appears slowly , a fairy boy of eleven , a changeling , kidnapped , dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet , holding a book in his hand .	34.666164034280214
he reads from right to left inaudibly , smiling , kissing the page .	2.2258148507657163
bloom wonderstruck , calls inaudibly .	1.397895921802531
rudy !	1
rudy gazes , unseeing , into bloom’s eyes and goes on reading , kissing , smiling .	3.2277419154873144
he has a delicate mauve face .	1.3743156212193341
on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons .	1.651428403659367
in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot .	3.499983711466358
a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket .	3.258118175396198

preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed .	8.524270612371982
his ( stephen’s ) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting , off the reel , the propriety of the cabman’s shelter , as it was called , hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral .	1055.0836305520288
but how to get there was the rub .	1.8593105543198891
for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned .	4.462701649379786
so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition , both of them being e.d.ed , particularly stephen , always assuming that there was such a thing to be found .	46.31940295886275
accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing , in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line , they both walked together along beaver street or , more properly , lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin’s .	322.8974256817264
but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler , probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree , outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom , who was anything but a professional whistler , endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle , holding his arms arched over his head , twice .	247.17364689879852
this was a quandary but , bringing common sense to bear on it , evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did .	11.000540092551407
so , bevelling around by mullett’s and the signal house which they shortly reached , they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus , mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had , to vary the timehonoured adage , gone the way of all buttons though , entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing , he heroically made light of the mischance .	493.8261723326646
so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time , as it happened , and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius , they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey .	12.717178566106563
as it so happened a dublin united tramways company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back .	6.086861622175638
they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station , the starting point for belfast , where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue ( a not very enticing locality , not to say gruesome to a degree , more especially at night ) ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street , famous for its c division police station .	39.170357844457165
between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen , associated with baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in talbot place , first turning on the right , while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke’s city bakery , situated quite close to where they were , the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread , of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable .	143.7742353026414
bread , the staff of life , earn your bread , o tell me where is fancy bread , at rourke’s the baker’s it is said .	9.268483705019031
en route to his taciturn and , not to put too fine a point on it , not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties , never more so , in fact disgustingly sober , spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown , women of ill fame and swell mobsmen , which , barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice , was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out .	4758.294989427493
highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or , failing that , the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or , he being the solicitor rather , old wall , he meant to say , or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about .	715.470125861568
the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen , whom he cordially disliked , were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and , as mr bloom put it , recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street , prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot .	55.17794451073565
never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city , pembroke road for example , the guardians of the law were well in evidence , the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes .	15.144359408229946
another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything .	3.4424569960216274
you frittered away your time , he very sensibly maintained , and health and also character besides which , the squandermania of the thing , fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of £ .	14.49005137242446
s .	1
d .	1
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though , touching the much vexed question of stimulants , he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues ( notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in ) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically .	171.52713804804392
most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confrères but one , a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs .	13.286093325437355
and that one was judas , stephen said , who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind .	3.613286064032055
discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps .	29.262821888374624
stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox .	38.91985703755218
he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s , gumley .	9.061897785846362
to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge .	4.589911721997542
someone saluted you , mr bloom said .	3.105591289412771
a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again , calling	2.786066365042746
night !	1
stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment .	1.7216752114445553
mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least .	11.306039942598462
though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper , famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice , your money or your life , leaving you there to point a moral , gagged and garrotted .	172.30778209783546
stephen , that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters , though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice .	7.282474581145887
lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise .	1.6590857831456036
he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division , lately deceased , who had married a certain katherine brophy , the daughter of a louth farmer .	15.791489441543275
his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine ( also ) talbot .	2.9468306086920784
rumour had it ( though not proved ) that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion , really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing , her mother or aunt or some relative , a woman , as the tale went , of extreme beauty , had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen .	102.13891974134447
this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley .	2.8887659172563556
taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell .	2.352629806206024
not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings .	2.201273251410462
his friends had all deserted him .	1.362735945035749
furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions .	5.700681145601325
he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god’s earth he could get something , anything at all , to do .	6.467102583941909
no , it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way , both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish .	122.10984438544904
anyhow he was all in .	1.20600965349266
i wouldn’t ask you only , pursued he , on my solemn oath and god knows i’m on the rocks .	2.546061625787836
there’ll be a job tomorrow or next day , stephen told him , in a boys’ school at dalkey for a gentleman usher .	5.217458775466549
mr garrett deasy .	1.0271647111213709
try it .	1
you may mention my name .	1.4338925332809118
ah , god , corley replied , sure i couldn’t teach in a school , man .	3.7932406490236557
i was never one of your bright ones , he added with a half laugh .	4.341010836027682
i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers .	3.075036898405282
i have no place to sleep myself , stephen informed him .	2.1633951356030963
corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street .	9.144664447471957
there was a dosshouse in marlborough street , mrs maloney’s , but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m’conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street ( which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon ) for a bob .	32.95505735622685
he was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it .	2.5977054205866073
though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence .	12.370508143742017
however haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished .	239.02720794511737
but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful .	10.895361189556688
whereas .	1
he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for , to his chagrin , he found his cash missing .	19.725383384200214
a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation .	1.9617276828741619
he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout , very much the reverse in fact .	10.651538758608275
he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect .	2.4307324504793537
about biscuits he dimly remembered .	1.361577577381861
who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy .	1.8022873901752618
however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies , erroneously however , as it turned out .	6.546939690282746
those are halfcrowns , man , corley corrected him .	2.1728501896378196
and so in point of fact they turned out to be .	3.6924270228013443
stephen anyhow lent him one of them .	1.9390128821264452
thanks , corley answered , you’re a gentleman .	1.9660886423027242
i’ll pay you back one time .	1.430252691947207
who’s that with you ?	1.0696896812363466
i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan , the billsticker .	5.446144538403268
you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there .	3.372622200610063
i’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks , man .	7.537404805140507
god , you’ve to book ahead , man , you’d think it was for the carl rosa .	3.884177096568602
i don’t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job , even as a crossing sweeper .	3.920282395589019
subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullam’s , the shipchandler’s , bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle’s back with o’mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe .	104.27489266740389
anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable .	5.646504913326296
mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work , it struck him , was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept .	33.73039584253083
he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when .	20.54211555291989
being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity .	4.653730736097677
palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round , in every deep , so to put it , a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether .	472.24721759146155
in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning .	5.699156077070449
pretty thick that was certainly .	1.3297516439081465
the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who , with his practised eye , was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite .	18.54451312270346
alluding to the encounter he said , laughingly , stephen , that is	2.887158841357248
he is down on his luck .	2.9466656022668167
he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan , a billsticker , to give him a job as a sandwichman .	8.58769218619602
at this intelligence , in which he seemingly evinced little interest , mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger , rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana , moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair , whereupon he observed evasively	37.82071682038726
everybody gets their own ration of luck , they say .	3.0517209260871696
now you mention it his face was familiar to me .	2.534735424925613
but , leaving that for the moment , how much did you part with , he queried , if i am not too inquisitive ?	5.2350071513563385
half a crown , stephen responded .	1.4307080664398908
i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere .	1.5974486368329819
needs !	1
mr bloom ejaculated , professing not the least surprise at the intelligence , i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does .	4.289360679045952
everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds .	1.6342500799980377
but , talking about things in general , where , added he with a smile , will you sleep yourself ?	6.8817778899635185
walking to sandycove is out of the question .	2.1887587217656503
and even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at westland row station .	3.3611918987507527
simply fag out there for nothing .	1.4976329315931267
i don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house ?	5.927104192060043
to seek misfortune , was stephen’s answer .	1.7004574654431939
i met your respected father on a recent occasion , mr bloom diplomatically returned , today in fact , or to be strictly accurate , on yesterday .	6.053632550936281
where does he live at present ?	1.049413921400716
i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved .	2.498508384033406
i believe he is in dublin somewhere , stephen answered unconcernedly .	2.0772785783707217
why ?	1
a gifted man , mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior , in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one .	9.662801192494763
he takes great pride , quite legitimate , out of you .	2.108372371523259
you could go back perhaps , he hasarded , still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two , mulligan , that is , and that english tourist friend of his , who eventually euchred their third companion , were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion , which they did .	147.8827739499631
there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however , such as it was , stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle , her hair hanging down , waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy , boody and katey , the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper , in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded , it being quarter tense or if not , ember days or something like that .	29029.882246315745
no , mr bloom repeated again , i wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element , dr mulligan , as a guide , philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes .	12.82520003144017
he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals .	13.46820951804832
of course you didn’t notice as much as i did .	2.116022525223601
but it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object .	3.361137132163267
he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man , by no means confined to medicine only , who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and , if the report was verified , bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries , or malahide was it ?	231.17333140666585
, was , he was bound to admit , an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise , so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy , pure and simple .	16.583406179294926
except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains , he ventured to throw out .	3.1966503438677654
the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light , none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less .	194.86807926852563
grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that , high educational abilities though he possessed , he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet .	6.1917062564062055
adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way , there being some little differences between the parties .	8.089507082210082
puttana madonna , che ci dia i quattrini !	1.0476765118131497
ho ragione ?	1
culo rotto !	1
intendiamoci .	1
mezzo sovrano più.. .	1.2106187701920679
dice lui , però !	1.0274625238163728
mezzo .	1
farabutto !	1
mortacci sui !	1
ma ascolta !	1
cinque la testa più.. .	1.2106808558176954
mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman’s shelter , an unpretentious wooden structure , where , prior to then , he had rarely if ever been before , the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin-the-goat fitzharris , the invincible , though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in .	114.59653299291287
a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity .	28.778559284850218
now touching a cup of coffee , mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice , it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food , say , a roll of some description .	19.984580542478877
accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly .	1.5311838265788598
the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied , away though one redbearded bibulous individual , portion of whose hair was greyish , a sailor probably , still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor .	9.200286312341976
mr bloom , availing himself of the right of free speech , he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute , though , to be sure , rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his protégé in an audible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious	65.94351657305248
a beautiful language .	1.2203179238061463
i mean for singing purposes .	1.2109198483871613
why do you not write your poetry in that language ?	1.2908845053429243
bella poetria !	1
it is so melodious and full .	1.2075257428987556
belladonna .	1
voglio .	1
stephen , who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could , suffering from lassitude generally , replied	2.553243710583894
to fill the ear of a cow elephant .	2.2882183815406503
they were haggling over money .	1.4391238653807166
is that so ?	1.4345877347416789
mr bloom asked .	1.2532087128507625
of course , he subjoined pensively , at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary , it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it .	6.72483104781764
the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête-à-tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun , or so it seemed .	11.573896380246625
after which he beat a retreat to his counter , mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to .	19.08959441988443
for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him .	6.269785397616849
sounds are impostures , stephen said after a pause of some little time , like names .	3.5769048530539305
cicero , podmore , napoleon , mr goodbody .	1.5794916444068146
jesus , mr doyle .	1.108742876107619
shakespeares were as common as murphies .	1.3724080180070868
what’s in a name ?	1.444244764344376
yes , to be sure , mr bloom unaffectedly concurred .	4.320775750212957
of course .	1
our name was changed too , he added , pushing the socalled roll across .	1.9509557521885863
the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen , whom he had singled out for attention in particular , squarely by asking	4.764691642723198
and what might your name be ?	1.0723845697964844
just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion’s boot but stephen , apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter , answered	3.12109125543997
dedalus .	1
the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes , rather bunged up from excessive use of boose , preferably good old hollands and water .	16.362680868358467
you know simon dedalus ?	1.3648905164813145
he asked at length .	1.3124789201665914
i’ve heard of him , stephen said .	2.4148848317249323
mr bloom was all at sea for a moment , seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too .	5.583701838516547
he’s irish , the seaman bold affirmed , staring still in much the same way and nodding .	2.2273530777970727
all irish .	1
all too irish , stephen rejoined .	1.718900961058081
as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark	19.135013938946365
i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder .	2.655358326594442
the lefthand dead shot .	1.3090133419304077
though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain .	2.606791517427943
bottles out there , say .	2.0229233293097386
fifty yards measured .	1.1284900140010166
eggs on the bottles .	1.1177448947064108
cocks his gun over his shoulder .	2.295410603009453
aims .	1
he turned his body half round , shut up his right eye completely .	3.0803817098109594
then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance .	2.827088841140765
pom !	1
he then shouted once .	1.3468286380560088
the entire audience waited , anticipating an additional detonation , there being still a further egg .	2.414073944402854
pom !	1
he shouted twice .	1.358282768335308
egg two evidently demolished , he nodded and winked , adding bloodthirstily	1.4910495840798212
buffalo bill shoots to kill ,	1.0912078703373769
never missed nor he never will .	1.1708856393618552
a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley .	2.87701291981031
beg pardon , the sailor said .	1.5984058243848855
long ago ?	1
mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth .	1.2875565447239457
why , the sailor replied , relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond , it might be a matter of ten years .	10.354821948973491
he toured the wide world with hengler’s royal circus .	2.0934543657762927
i seen him do that in stockholm .	1.3451587775597749
curious coincidence , mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively .	2.0063740798205028
murphy’s my name , the sailor continued .	1.638108741950119
d. b. murphy of carrigaloe .	1.2449366532605208
know where that is ?	1.1143748682379797
queenstown harbour , stephen replied .	1.1190968431169774
that’s right , the sailor said .	1.5264052699261017
fort camden and fort carlisle .	1.1287149116858466
that’s where i hails from .	1.0928926896163573
i belongs there .	1.304183171527667
that’s where i hails from .	1.0928926896163573
my little woman’s down there .	1.5746346590598745
she’s waiting for me , i know .	2.033086748685057
for england , home and beauty .	2.1881941837986876
she’s my own true wife i haven’t seen for seven years now , sailing about .	2.232361583309573
mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene , the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones , a rainy night with a blind moon .	6.1931527320246
across the world for a wife .	1.4042341081137648
quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic , enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc o’leary , a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way .	24.97449974131618
never about the runaway wife coming back , however much devoted to the absentee .	2.396378179593156
the face at the window !	1.3214233856990518
judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half , wrecked in his affections .	5.595001561183165
you little expected me but i’ve come to stay and make a fresh start .	2.0520756980382324
there she sits , a grasswidow , at the selfsame fireside .	2.3855860251217758
believes me dead , rocked in the cradle of the deep .	2.4530336345003083
and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin , as the case might be , the publican of the crown and anchor , in shirtsleeves , eating rumpsteak and onions .	16.2132245556428
no chair for father .	1.223968880275124
broo !	1
the wind !	1
her brandnew arrival is on her knee , post mortem child .	1.8162246846501426
with a high ro !	1.0154623149137723
and a randy ro !	1.4263620912563355
and my galloping tearing tandy , o !	1.4437120744264953
bow to the inevitable .	1.2106237865859018
grin and bear it .	1.3591943512823756
i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband w. b. murphy .	1.1235037969130945
the sailor , who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident , turned to one of the jarvies with the request	4.626968218163672
you don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you ?	1.9322335624079903
the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand .	6.372429071657771
thank you , the sailor said .	1.5356996145171937
he deposited the quid in his gob and , chewing and with some slow stammers , proceeded	1.936815377851345
we come up this morning eleven o’clock .	1.625267555125064

see ?	1
d. b. murphy .	1.0758354967788757
a. b. s.	1
in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document .	2.8701127144447725
you must have seen a fair share of the world , the keeper remarked , leaning on the counter .	12.098823194543474
why , the sailor answered upon reflection upon it , i’ve circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on .	1.7777617566048018
i was in the red sea .	2.1322230548337724
i was in china and north america and south america .	1.534193685585827
we was chased by pirates one voyage .	1.6177792382673766
i seen icebergs plenty , growlers .	1.307801890442555
i was in stockholm and the black sea , the dardanelles under captain dalton , the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship .	3.9396809701378857
i seen russia .	1.2106187701920679
gospodi pomilyou .	1
that’s how the russians prays .	1.129276217214298
you seen queer sights , don’t be talking , put in a jarvey .	2.7490916374041374
why , the sailor said , shifting his partially chewed plug .	1.6007185107247275
i seen queer things too , ups and downs .	1.8493778841033075
i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid .	2.5822912556095003
he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and , lodging it between his teeth , bit ferociously	3.7934132430151286
khaan !	1
like that .	1
and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses .	2.1884489986513183
look here .	1
here they are .	1.2579842826097125
a friend of mine sent me .	1.8661278672786081
he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table .	10.466161018026655
the printed matter on it stated choza de indios .	1.4582842835286203
beni , bolivia .	1.2106187701920679
all focussed their attention at the scene exhibited , a group of savage women in striped loincloths , squatted , blinking , suckling , frowning , sleeping amid a swarm of infants ( there must have been quite a score of them ) outside some primitive shanties of osier .	26.12450908435874
chews coca all day , the communicative tarpaulin added .	2.370991209270614
stomachs like breadgraters .	1.2106187701920679
cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children .	2.437675058888165
see them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw .	1.450939071278579
his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more .	1.7981001652270705
know how to keep them off ?	1.3290331900910577
he inquired generally .	1.1284900140010166
nobody volunteering a statement he winked , saying	1.0910129240654973
glass .	1
that boggles ’em .	1.3966331459318944
glass .	1
mr bloom , without evincing surprise , unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark .	3.8059622317104633
it ran as follows tarjeta postal , señor a boudin , galeria becche , santiago , chile .	1.9293470143067042
there was no message evidently , as he took particular notice .	2.2023860678987743
though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated ( or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillo-don cesar de bazan incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat ) having detected a discrepancy between his name ( assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere ) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest .	3399.677907936223
martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through .	4.261627184962647
but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd’s heart it was not so dear , purse permitting , a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six , there and back .	14.89536351085102
the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable , especially for a chap whose liver was out of order , seeing the different places along the route , plymouth , falmouth , southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis , the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement , tower , abbey , wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with .	351.77495090323623
another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts , margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas , eastbourne , scarborough , margate and so on , beautiful bournemouth , the channel islands and similar bijou spots , which might prove highly remunerative .	66.24288029140534
not , of course , with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job , witness mrs c p m’coy type lend me your valise and i’ll post you the ticket .	18.143613365790717
no , something top notch , an all star irish caste , the tweedy-flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody-manners , perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success , providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure .	176.50612461093172
but who ?	1
that was the rub .	1.1285151756638203
also , without being actually positive , it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguard-rosslare route which , it was mooted , was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally .	73.90073712525955
a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large , the average man , i.e. brown , robinson and co .	4.1447227280231065
it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street , when the system really needed toning up , for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife .	125.64251708863816
after all , hang it , they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life .	15.962587442788283
there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island , delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation , offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even , poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram , but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow , rightly termed the garden of ireland , an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down , and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the coup d’œil was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise , silken thomas , grace o’malley , george iv , rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy , though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally , usually , by the way , on their left leg , it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar .	912326.3599651272
because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy , so to speak , and the accommodation left much to be desired .	5.705581497688356
interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity , pure and simple , was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact .	8.864658706810163
he turned back the other side of the card , picture , and passed it along to stephen .	5.191066981286154
i seen a chinese one time , related the doughty narrator , that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different .	6.3502391131225355
one was a ship , another was a house , another was a flower .	3.2085621986405437
cooks rats in your soup , he appetisingly added , the chinks does .	2.613231842212033
possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on , adhering to his adventures .	2.4070166180441763
and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap .	1.8198524665248486
knife in his back .	1.23935927457143
knife like that .	1.3439658695844507
whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position .	4.492551232971064
in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers .	2.070614128549719
fellow hid behind a door , come up behind him .	2.9467444897391166
like that .	1
prepare to meet your god says he .	1.9382271376411169
chuk !	1
it went into his back up to the butt .	2.555115786909912
his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to .	2.5313180803678814
that’s a good bit of steel , repeated he , examining his formidable stiletto .	2.1032479444447256
after which harrowing dénouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors , otherwise pocket .	5.6389849928917775
they’re great for the cold steel , somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all .	6.516250123596581
that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives .	2.2624615264612937
at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss mr b. and stephen , each in his own particular way , both instinctively exchanged meaning glances , in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however , towards where skin-the-goat , alias the keeper , not turning a hair , was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair .	51.90089513186257
his inscrutable face which was really a work of art , a perfect study in itself , beggaring description , conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on .	12.120893099864967
funny , very !	1.007414961966664
there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause .	1.4033834134940693
one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal , another the card with the natives choza de another the seaman’s discharge .	2.3962192145359897
mr bloom , so far as he was personally concerned , was just pondering in pensive mood .	3.3330638326718347
he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday , roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles , when it took the civilised world by storm , figuratively speaking , early in the eighties , eightyone to be correct , when he was just turned fifteen .	162.19565701602147
ay , boss , the sailor broke in .	2.1991498018913442
give us back them papers .	1.3174175369490169
the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape .	3.041768460989676
have you seen the rock of gibraltar ?	1.86227938968128
mr bloom inquired .	1.2106187701920679
the sailor grimaced , chewing , in a way that might be read as yes , ay or no .	5.112214396688032
ah , you’ve touched there too , mr bloom said , europa point , thinking he had , in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so , simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust , and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn .	143.32620604511203
what year would that be about ?	1.0730659962299571
mr b interrogated .	1.1284900140010166
can you recall the boats ?	1.0357286591439727
our soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering	1.0032945679711334
i’m tired of all them rocks in the sea , he said , and boats and ships .	6.706311176292578
salt junk all the time .	2.2618672567509956
tired seemingly , he ceased .	1.5565776354713985
his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer , fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe , suffice it to say that , as a casual glance at the map revealed , it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves .	206.25765799780945
on more than one occasion , a dozen at the lowest , near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt , evidently derelict , seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall , staring quite obliviously at it and it at him , dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings .	34.47847534449673
and it left him wondering why .	1.2043782278110262
possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself , floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under , well , not exactly under , tempting the fates .	19.525055559387045
and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all .	3.0442359541698982
nevertheless , without going into the minutiae of the business , the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large , no matter where living inland or seaside , as the case might be , having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights , kish and others , liable to capsize at any moment , rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy , not to say stormy , weather .	554353.862628324
there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old seadog , himself a rover , proceeded , went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month .	11.268533642804156
them are his trousers i’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife .	1.964048405531157
i’m game for that job , shaving and brushup .	1.930829413898059
i hate roaming about .	1.1903677190060935
there’s my son now , danny , run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in cork where he could be drawing easy money .	5.173729813609982
what age is he ?	1.4545712808409892
queried one hearer who , by the way , seen from the side , bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell , the townclerk , away from the carking cares of office , unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage .	101.45604098968624
why , the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance , my son , danny ?	2.2286169869228423
he’d be about eighteen now , way i figure it .	1.6874348279544495
the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor .	5.882706663321414
there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater , he remarked , sure as nuts .	1.9667416455644815
i must get a wash tomorrow or next day .	2.028543030962895
it’s them black lads i objects to .	1.1525054438563986
i hate those buggers .	1.2106462834129836
suck your blood dry , they does .	1.3759835689256947
seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather .	31.278236421955935
tattoo , the exhibitor explained .	1.095016908986598
that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton .	2.7315268927874907
fellow , the name of antonio , done that .	1.6593917014682875
there he is himself , a greek .	1.2889136630882452
did it hurt much doing it ?	1.2075041575011303
one asked the sailor .	1.0722965053800984
that worthy , however , was busily engaged in collecting round the .	2.1428345396807003
someway in his .	1.0484050231883766
squeezing or .	1
see here , he said , showing antonio .	2.8891692951023153
there he is cursing the mate .	1.7246390341427387
and there he is now , he added , the same fellow , pulling the skin with his fingers , some special knack evidently , and he laughing at a yarn .	6.877520592585681
and in point of fact the young man named antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skin-the-goat , who this time stretched over .	6.608287700334056
ay , ay , sighed the sailor , looking down on his manly chest .	3.501108820345801
he’s gone too .	1.3085308979041994
ate by sharks after .	1.205350626602811
ay , ay .	1.4006845038799651
he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before .	3.5069704181096233
neat bit of work , one longshoreman said .	1.6244438544949946
and what’s the number for ?	1.0367516316159266
loafer number two queried .	1.4307049527547229
eaten alive ?	1
a third asked the sailor .	1.1863864992597588
ay , ay , sighed again the latter personage , more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number .	16.296536691100467
ate .	1
a greek he was .	1.3261322700754157
and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end	1.0638983101056165
as bad as old antonio , for he left me on my ownio .	8.143361125575858
the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill .	19.390546191976927
mr bloom , scarcely knowing which way to look , turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm , and , picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey , if such he was , had laid aside , he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink .	171.18052136589904
his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay , the partially idiotic female , namely , of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you ( mrs b. ) and begged the chance of his washing .	193.45302155610557
also why washing which seemed rather vague than not , your washing .	1.2873861616734097
still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with bewley and draper’s marking ink ( hers were , that is ) if they really loved him , that is to say , love me , love my dirty shirt .	32.10702425807886
still just then , being on tenterhooks , he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off .	5.635202762057056
round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there , viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her .	190.65373732764985
the gunboat , the keeper said .	1.6951457857520118
it beats me , mr bloom confided to stephen , medically i am speaking , how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses , if he values his health in the least .	48.42682359681449
unfortunate creature !	1
of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition .	2.966733518715269
still no matter what the cause is from.. .	1.3484772976641994
stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders , merely remarking	1.3670991572624922
in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade .	2.2130664311467236
fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul .	1.8126946476120536
she is a bad merchant .	1.3345788651307626
she buys dear and sells cheap .	1.313277372948475
the elder man , though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude , said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp ( quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject ), a necessary evil , were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities , a thing , he could truthfully state , he , as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start .	444.13124784151285
whoever embarked on a policy of the sort , he said , and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned .	8.742305780034185
you as a good catholic , he observed , talking of body and soul , believe in the soul .	4.388787268653525
or do you mean the intelligence , the brainpower as such , as distinct from any outside object , the table , let us say , that cup .	11.539216840371038
i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter .	5.0520461645688055
otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays , for instance .	2.5261842500224096
do you ?	1
thus cornered , stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say	2.195568953268467
they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible .	2.434326594063438
it would be immortal , i understand , but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who , from all i can hear , is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes , corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette .	21.017138469056864
mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple , promptly rejoining	11.96163644764992
simple ?	1
i shouldn’t think that is the proper word .	1.8817921556242105
of course , i grant you , to concede a point , you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon .	9.311812551483355
but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison , though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man , i mean , and the same applies to the laws , for example , of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god .	204.2391639840752
o that , stephen expostulated , has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ , apart from circumstantial evidence .	3.9352468444128803
on this knotty point however the views of the pair , poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages , clashed .	6.219837826415833
has been ?	1
the more experienced of the two objected , sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief .	4.325022506727
i’m not so sure about that .	1.6972438773811944
that’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and , without dragging in the sectarian side of the business , i beg to differ with you in toto there .	8.132599421743464
my belief is , to tell you the candid truth , that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again , who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon , as , you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i , of course i needn’t tell you .	62.052682703533996
can’t you drink that coffee , by the way ?	3.7082442629161623
let me stir it .	1.3194713773950033
and take a piece of that bun .	1.6647790904494262
it’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised .	1.377466268387317
still no-one can give what he hasn’t got .	1.2943903624624675
try a bit .	1.3487835668291384
couldn’t , stephen contrived to get out , his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further .	3.336681131853462
faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance ( and lucrative ) work .	9.015366001231047
to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good , shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night , concerts , dramatic evenings and useful lectures ( admittance free ) by qualified men for the lower orders .	27.650466065074113
on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife , madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time , a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying .	9.21493452985042
the idea , he was strongly inclined to believe , was to do good and net a profit , there being no competition to speak of .	4.46099032053738
sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where .	3.9175102597560194
anyhow inspection , medical inspection , of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble’s vi-cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved .	7.668718578146377
have a shot at it now , he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred .	2.3275880381602945
thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage .	12.679116700685004
still it’s solid food , his good genius urged , i’m a stickler for solid food , his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work , mental or manual .	10.546228543045679
you ought to eat more solid food .	1.3558381954333727
you would feel a different man .	1.4687887301914446
liquids i can eat , stephen said .	2.0981956289028503
but o , oblige me by taking away that knife .	1.5669908655758877
i can’t look at the point of it .	3.8492699370448533
it reminds me of roman history .	1.7309345564026075
mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article , a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye , observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it .	6.811779317117303
our mutual friend’s stories are like himself , mr bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce .	2.5554550095434267
do you think they are genuine ?	1.1167445803133087
he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots .	1.8858518764471153
look at him .	1.4306312104016385
yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel .	59.011238087686706
he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him .	5.836250357586863
though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina , if a trifle prone to baldness , there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity .	14.95807985791171
he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told , as people often did about others , namely , that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage ( no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet ) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described .	60.53486965023666
on the other hand he might be only bluffing , a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs , dublin residents , like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera .	9.990843573398273
and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him .	2.9210163265042914
mind you , i’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention , he resumed .	2.7772652513921474
analogous scenes are occasionally , if not often , met with .	1.573588130939815
giants , though that is rather a far cry , you see once in a way , marcella the midget queen .	7.069869395983203
in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs , as they are called , sitting bowlegged , they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here , you see , he proceeded , indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee , were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up , being adored as gods .	154.83609292108574
there’s an example again of simple souls .	1.395568115001262
however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures ( who reminded him a bit of ludwig , alias ledwidge , when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the flying dutchman a stupendous success , and his host of admirers came in large numbers , everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort , phantom or the reverse , on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains ) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it , he conceded .	222.60241995977435
on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and , he added , on the cheap .	352.5681820420881
spaniards , for instance , he continued , passionate temperaments like that , impetuous as old nick , are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen .	14.961093125015111
it comes from the great heat , climate generally .	1.8939783406947523
my wife is , so to speak , spanish , half that is .	4.623881073457202
point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted , having been born in ( technically ) spain , i.e. gibraltar .	3.3011617600294723
she has the spanish type .	1.4383295109841294
quite dark , regular brunette , black .	1.3160376740259476
i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character .	1.4584286167830114
that’s why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian .	1.9452197247802387
the temperaments at the door , stephen interposed with , were very passionate about ten shillings .	2.9701013026888377
roberto ruba roba sua .	1.1286482541409768
quite so , mr bloom dittoed .	1.8108028456988103
then , stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere , we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino .	13.657598216651726
it’s in the blood , mr bloom acceded at once .	2.5129149834571027
all are washed in the blood of the sun .	3.662719235986495
coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today , shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it , and i was just looking at those antique statues there .	51.2551864123995
the splendid proportions of hips , bosom .	1.641052225257673
you simply don’t knock against those kind of women here .	1.9896520721582156
an exception here and there .	1.913616620072594
handsome yes , pretty in a way you find but what i’m talking about is the female form .	2.8949730265171567
besides they have so little taste in dress , most of them , which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty , no matter what you say .	6.8242881955888235
rumpled stockings , it may be , possibly is , a foible of mine but still it’s a thing i simply hate to see .	8.06850243359995
interest , however , was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea , ships lost in a fog , collisions with icebergs , all that sort of thing .	11.974412987381855
shipahoy of course had his own say to say .	1.5442675987476686
he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon , a kind of wind , in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing , he declared , stood to him or words to that effect , a pious medal he had that saved him .	112.16173420431056
so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt’s rock , wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it palme on booterstown strand .	17.5511629390864
that was the talk of the town that year ( albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror .	19.467929382286037
then someone said something about the case of the s .	3.645871849844296
s .	1
lady cairns of swansea run into by the mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck .	2.372682202873505
no aid was given .	1.0811825781448061
her master , the mona ’s , said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way .	2.415222180897643
she had no water , it appears , in her hold .	2.1297802305798377
at this stage an incident happened .	1.329088193569387
it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat .	2.2387178896238114
let me cross your bows mate , he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze .	4.006648190682551
he made tracks heavily , slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door , stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left .	25.973666292599745
while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior , saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and , applying its nozzle to his lips , take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise .	1267.7738747631608
the irrepressible bloom , who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes , could by straining just perceive him , when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit , gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved .	339.95007171232686
some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor , evidently giving it a wide berth , eased himself closer at hand , the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank .	148.75649719661376
a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled .	1.5293896469919528
slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who , though now broken down and fast breaking up , was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid , now practically on the parish rates , given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus , a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of .	998.6261187320031
and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver .	4.766560036260729
he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if a big if , however he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality .	15.572502376195079
all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping , coastwise and foreign as well , which was all part and parcel of the same thing .	4.723769690028668
a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin , the only launch that year .	2.1973717868425937
right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called .	1.272366474876009
there were wrecks and wreckers , the keeper said , who was evidently au fait .	2.638015988010928
what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that , eh ?	11.509029401960095
ask the then captain , he advised them , how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day’s work , captain john lever of the lever line .	6.042776224044744
am i right , skipper ?	1.1599345058966075
he queried of the sailor , now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions .	5.296394878585348
that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds .	8.759257079123625
mr bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably ( which it was ), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question .	50.45862106338099
anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation- cum -potation , introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée boisterously trolling , like a veritable son of a seacook	7.817209607397124
the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lot’s wife’s arse .	2.063255998557128
o , johnny lever !	1.0155090258967359
johnny lever , o !	1.1125296629459542
after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided .	4.266952441827527
skin-the-goat , assuming he was he , evidently with an axe to grind , was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of god’s earth , far and away superior to england , with coal in large quantities , six million pounds worth of pork exported every year , ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein .	3732.4946932908224
their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact .	2.2310845038016076
you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil , he stated , and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco .	3.648761116726764
where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon ?	1.6109333587375896
but a day of reckoning , he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice , thoroughly monopolising all the conversation , was in store for mighty england , despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes .	5.194923800206824
there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history .	1.8461981932460048
the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin , he affirmed .	2.1728473695665547
the boers were the beginning of the end .	1.8971563783879546
brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland , her achilles heel , which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles , the greek hero , a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot .	54.26690813214735
his advice to every irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland .	4.924187288856773
ireland , parnell said , could not spare a single one of her sons .	3.5568183771122506
silence all round marked the termination of his finale .	1.6061717009064185
the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings , undismayed .	1.3735803431254443
take a bit of doing , boss , retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism .	3.829571159641279
to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view .	2.495018042098803
who’s the best troops in the army ?	1.5043348584544565
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated .	1.1286993798449532
and the best jumpers and racers ?	1.1222608689327813
and the best admirals and generals we’ve got ?	1.1293685206243338
tell me that .	1.101552703395225
the irish , for choice , retorted the cabby like campbell , facial blemishes apart .	2.307246235342967
that’s right , the old tarpaulin corroborated .	1.3156646241414907
the irish catholic peasant .	1.1285051029987307
he’s the backbone of our empire .	1.4295535026758301
you know jem mullins ?	1.0359814233788602
while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire , ours or his , and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it .	3.9342217751850526
then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter , both , needless to say , appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows .	37.69077605302927
from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for , pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for , he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel , unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for , rather concealed their strength than the opposite .	120.05791108061668
it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if , as time went on , that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies , equally relevant to the issue , might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart .	365.04135400309565
another little interesting point , the amours of whores and chummies , to put it in common parlance , reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her , more so , in fact .	13.137849727094972
and now , why ?	1.3654670186752416
so the scene between the pair of them , the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris , the famous invincible , and the other , obviously bogus , reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick , supposing , that is , it was prearranged as the lookeron , a student of the human soul if anything , the others seeing least of the game .	409.1230031805332
and as for the lessee or keeper , who probably wasn’t the other person at all , he ( b. ) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting , there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like denis or peter carey , an idea he utterly repudiated .	398.02111911532353
quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle .	1.6128228297220617
yet , though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form , he certainly did feel and no denying it ( while inwardly remaining what he was ) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife , cold steel , with the courage of his political convictions ( though , personally , he would never be a party to any such thing ), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south , have her or swing for her , when the husband frequently , after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal ( he having had the pair watched ), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her , until it just struck him that fitz , nicknamed skin-the-goat , merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not , if he was reliably informed , actually party to the ambush which , in point of fact , was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on .	146902.0525432275
in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend , the pseudo skin-the-etcetera , he had transparently outlived his welcome .	4.865586804574243
he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high .	2.2912967184417545
like actresses , always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again .	2.1482790305092516
generous to a fault of course , temperamental , no economising or any idea of the sort , always snapping at the bone for the shadow .	7.912079349948005
so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some £ .	2.851787029874518
s .	1
d .	1
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern , come back to erin and so on .	18.90249348440996
then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender .	5.20598501074246
he took umbrage at something or other , that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared , i let slip .	2.694013247061054
he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively .	2.0068124646607144
so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god , i mean christ , was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality i’m not .	15.627519712340339
that was one for him .	1.5077946302672869
a soft answer turns away wrath .	1.131142005558405
he hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw .	1.8865529550596771
am i not right ?	1.0333110160571464
he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly .	11.144286252427458
ex quibus stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent , their two or four eyes conversing , christus or bloom his name is or after all any other , secundum carnem .	3.744020291869685
of course , mr b. proceeded to stipulate , you must look at both sides of the question .	4.077000298614666
it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country , they say , our own distressful included , has the government it deserves .	10.650260160861146
but with a little goodwill all round .	1.1639171364813203
it’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality .	3.183137691693884
i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form .	1.4596297750104466
it never reaches anything or stops anything .	1.30817854396841
a revolution must come on the due instalments plan .	1.6391009097225047
it’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular , in the next house so to speak .	21.535962937375952
memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war , stephen assented , between skinner’s alley and ormond market .	3.1931549002966686
yes , mr bloom thoroughly agreed , entirely endorsing the remark , that was overwhelmingly right .	3.0139525683584645
and the whole world was full of that sort of thing .	2.103653826996707
you just took the words out of my mouth , he said .	4.603554220950276
a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely.. .	1.3014650910505237
all those wretched quarrels , in his humble opinion , stirring up bad blood , from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind , erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag , were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything , greed and jealousy , people never knowing when to stop .	50.01712525041944
they accuse , remarked he audibly .	1.2466725586459673
he turned away from the others , who probably… and spoke nearer to , so as the others… in case they…	4.758488490333762
jews , he softly imparted in an aside in stephen’s ear , are accused of ruining .	2.7453807886419184
not a vestige of truth in it , i can safely say .	2.06480115585689
history , would you be surprised to learn , proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell , an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for , imported them .	6.585065210444173
why ?	1
because they are imbued with the proper spirit .	1.705826746406439
they are practical and are proved to be so .	1.5896229637154404
i don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are .	5.108700506468738
but in the economic , not touching religion , domain the priest spells poverty .	1.6585682373798263
spain again , you saw in the war , compared with goahead america .	2.6485330663059106
turks .	1
it’s in the dogma .	1.1284978957534413
because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better , at least so i think .	3.190799222747574
that’s the juggle on which the p.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences .	2.9756406049794113
i’m , he resumed with dramatic force , as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone , concluded he , all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income , in no niggard fashion either , something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum .	31.39915890947153
that’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man .	2.1921146775940636
at least that’s my idea for what it’s worth .	1.344677566774462
i call that patriotism .	1.1285150055838764
ubi patria as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in alma mater , vita bene .	1.800819601444699
where you can live well , the sense is , if you work .	2.941584447740265
over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee , listening to this synopsis of things in general , stephen stared at nothing in particular .	9.935931553218174
he could hear , of course , all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to .	13.060819461805131
then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said , if you work .	5.91164925392178
count me out , he managed to remark , meaning work .	1.594520338453229
the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he , the person who owned them pro tem .	1.9278558079581796
observed or rather his voice speaking did , all must work , have to , together .	1.9523747891615835
i mean , of course , the other hastened to affirm , work in the widest possible sense .	5.07199101924266
also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing .	2.1685129448181
writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays .	1.8772448523303704
that’s work too .	1.4228007126191053
important work .	1
after all , from the little i know of you , after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price .	8.79645191665975
you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has .	1.9314681603653792
what ?	1
you both belong to ireland , the brain and the brawn .	3.443145746053147
each is equally important .	1.1286482541409768
you suspect , stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh , that i may be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called ireland for short .	7.227240971622664
i would go a step farther , mr bloom insinuated .	2.0597901911918193
but i suspect , stephen interrupted , that ireland must be important because it belongs to me .	4.684715146283197
what belongs , queried mr bloom bending , fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension .	2.7092909259178044
excuse me .	1
unfortunately , i didn’t catch the latter portion .	1.4383709984157507
what was it you... ?	1.0203471529830457
stephen , patently crosstempered , repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely , adding	3.5064461468482966
we can’t change the country .	1.57587616640043
let us change the subject .	2.224564330504405
at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom , to change the subject , looked down but in a quandary , as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry .	25.49032192945717
the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part .	1.8451087378182145
needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state .	4.020094033726107
probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people .	4.894276852561026
with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris , the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister , failing to throw much light on the subject , however , he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves .	294.6004524067987
for instance there was the case of o’callaghan , for one , the halfcrazy faddist , respectably connected though of inadequate means , with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper ( a fact ) .	53.43378042012012
and then the usual dénouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends , after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard , so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act , certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains .	99.86396172477856
briefly , putting two and two together , six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to , antonio and so forth , jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne , then heir apparent , the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state , he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature , a thing good mrs grundy , as the law stands , was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it .	159031.74014742818
ladies who like distinctive underclothing should , and every welltailored man must , trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two , she unbuttoned his and then he untied her , mind the pin , whereas savages in the cannibal islands , say , at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental .	67.67262774279918
however , reverting to the original , there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps .	24.38068245028064

for which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it .	19.080098588414014
still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small .	1.4759024570893227
intellectual stimulation , as such , was , he felt , from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind .	4.734878622689238

so to change the subject he read about dignam r. i. p. which , he reflected , was anything but a gay sendoff .	3.9149619093543517
or a change of address anyway .	1.574750866263116
this morning ( hynes put it in of course ) the remains of the late mr patrick dignam were removed from his residence , no 9 newbridge avenue , sandymount , for interment in glasnevin .	32.21533651244754
the deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted .	4.089427690937141
the obsequies , at which many friends of the deceased were present , were carried out ( certainly hynes wrote it with a nudge from corny ) by messrs h. j. o’neill and son , 164 north strand road .	17.163206944203914

all the same bloom ( properly so dubbed ) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years .	13.6180310461174
highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and , even supposing , he thought a return highly inadvisable , all things considered .	7.226711747091364
something evidently riled them in his death .	1.905953640129675
either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands .	22.402400751758
of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice , where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility .	42.56081220684869
naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure , a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet , whereas messrs so and so who , though they weren’t even a patch on the former man , ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between .	74.20903184595785

and then , number one , you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the tichborne case , roger charles tichborne , bella was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he , the heir , went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink , lord bellew was it , as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then , when got up to tally with the description given , introduce himself with excuse me , my name is so and so or some such commonplace remark .	5307.061302993861
a more prudent course , as bloom said to the not over effusive , in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him , would have been to sound the lie of the land first .	15.18911197127294

this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage .	2.241871358687156
as regards bloom he , without the faintest suspicion of a smile , merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts , to make matters worse , were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings .	56.74792738492147
first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed , however , who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into .	45.99666525950813
since their names were coupled , though , since he was her declared favourite , where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops , the fact , namely , that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel , having gained admittance in the same fashion , a fact the weeklies , addicted to the lubric a little , simply coined shoals of money out of .	17022.098099303123
whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch , with nothing in common between them beyond the name , and then a real man arriving on the scene , strong to the verge of weakness , falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties , the usual sequel , to bask in the loved one’s smiles .	412.0629345597677

a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order , as compared with the other military supernumerary that is ( who was just the usual everyday farewell , my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons , the 18th hussars to be accurate ) and inflammable doubtless ( the fallen leader , that is , not the other ) in his own peculiar way which she of course , woman , quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole , his erstwhile staunch adherents , and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations , very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose , thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick .	149211.62184788397
looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream .	2.941281180267287
and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times .	3.6900843221439668
why , as he reflected , irishtown strand , a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since , as it happened , he went to reside on the north side .	15.530876844066402
north or south , however , it was just the wellknown case of hot passion , pure and simple , upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so , types that wouldn’t do things by halves , passionate abandon of the south , casting every shred of decency to the winds .	97.8350653955942
just bears out what i was saying , he , with glowing bosom said to stephen , about blood and the sun .	6.736261706464307
and , if i don’t greatly mistake she was spanish too .	2.248143959094116
the king of spain’s daughter , stephen answered , adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and so many .	11.306704306535181
was she ?	1
bloom ejaculated , surprised though not astonished by any means , i never heard that rumour before .	1.8378916108421703
possible , especially there , it was as she lived there .	2.221309091956277
so , spain .	1.3026646887854645
carefully avoiding a book in his pocket sweets of which reminded him by the by of that capel street library book out of date , he took out his pocketbook and , turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he .	37.408786081959434
do you consider , by the by , he said , thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table , that a spanish type ?	10.505671833489858
stephen , obviously addressed , looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom , with more than vision of breasts , her full lips parted and some perfect teeth , standing near , ostensibly with gravity , a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad , pretty in its way , which was then all the vogue .	957.5933463983572
her ( the lady’s ) eyes , dark , large , looked at stephen , about to smile about something to be admired , lafayette of westmoreland street , dublin’s premier photographic artist , being responsible for the esthetic execution .	36.00468319075745
mrs bloom , my wife the prima donna madam marion tweedy , bloom indicated .	1.8490397816967605
taken a few years since .	1.2686084381655622
in or about ninety six .	1.398214035937664
very like her then .	1.4565186851732663
beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who , he intimated , was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen .	28.303984801143912
as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup .	19.350696276778343
she could without difficulty , he said , have posed for the ensemble , not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the .	12.708552066057093
he dwelt , being a bit of an artist in his spare time , on the female form in general developmentally because , as it so happened , no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues , perfectly developed as works of art , in the national museum .	54.509457097996105
marble could give the original , shoulders , back , all the symmetry , all the rest .	5.633173382654445
yes , puritanisme , it does though , saint joseph’s sovereign thievery alors ( bandez !	1.5586912036508282
) figne toi trop .	1.2106808558176954
whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word .	2.821198341044305
the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself , her stage presence being , frankly , a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to .	38.76692563213934
but it was scarcely professional etiquette so .	1.1861758319708708
though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering , for sunshine after storm .	5.719155321444586
and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion .	3.6937798346417896
nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves , none the worse for wear however , and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint .	32.08062610670753
in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled , good as new , much better in fact with the starch out .	4.783450326881923
suppose she was gone when he ?	1.278630671138955
i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray .	62.18557192790609
the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished , educated , distingué and impulsive into the bargain , far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would .	11.676596074898875
besides he said the picture was handsome which , say what you like , it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter .	5.982703888587801
and why not ?	1.411145026902635
an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business .	19.64139030170782
how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations , when the thing ran its normal course , became in due course intimate .	40.59441972366062
then the decree nisi and the king’s proctor tries to show cause why and , he failing to quash it , nisi was made absolute .	3.242320814926642
but as for that the two misdemeanants , wrapped up as they largely were in one another , could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course .	22.864018501974908
he , b , enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leader’s , who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery , ( leader’s ) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland ( a by no means by the by appropriate appellative ) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the o’brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals .	5161.123511936876
though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she , however , was the first to perceive .	17.967834249072162
as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach , fortunately not of a grave character .	15.501855143754527
his hat ( parnell’s ) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and , as a matter of strict history , bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him ( and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity ) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he , as a matter of fact , having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else , what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb saying thank you , sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day , history repeating itself with a difference , after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave .	8824151.854215985
on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest , laughing immoderately , pretending to understand everything , the why and the wherefore , and in reality not knowing their own minds , it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones , who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms , drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others .	131394.06747425772
he personally , being of a sceptical bias , believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady , even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument , when , neglecting her duties , she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent , the upshot being that her affections centred on another , the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men , no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt .	2005.5634754698046
it was a thousand pities a young fellow , blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was , should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime .	3.3718992423810525
in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts , not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson ( who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning ), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs .	811.896729464317
to think of him house and homeless , rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother , was really too bad at his age .	3.5607804631473785
the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or , failing that , the homely humpty dumpty boiled .	4.285354163423852
at what o’clock did you dine ?	1.3474962548983431
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face .	2.018537377074991
some time yesterday , stephen said .	2.1189993289241014
yesterday !	1
exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday .	1.9235962426068804
ah , you mean it’s after twelve !	1.1004621283167546
the day before yesterday , stephen said , improving on himself .	3.4714416676760083
literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected .	1.7147991197967538
though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling , so to speak , in the one train of thought .	9.72012442585831
at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect ( which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself ) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas .	39.578118789090865
for instance when the evicted tenants question , then at its first inception , bulked largely in people’s mind though , it goes without saying , not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums , some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water , he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion ( a partiality , however , which , realising his mistake , he was subsequently partially cured of ) and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander , which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that he , though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals , be it repeated , departed from his customary habit to give him ( metaphorically ) one in the gizzard though , so far as politics themselves were concerned , he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows , chiefly , destruction of the fittest , in a word .	342623.00113810966
anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons , getting on for one , as it was , it was high time to be retiring for the night .	15.453804131829326
the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue ( somebody having a temper of her own sometimes ) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog ( breed unknown ) with a lame paw ( not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too ) to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered , having been there , so to speak .	227.08732300989266
on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives .	20.26169443103319
everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity , all things considered .	9.581586922152873
his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway .	2.6341552391392744
for one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea , if approached , and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly , supposing he did entertain the proposal , as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe , if found suitable .	44.511044530924416
at all events he wound up by concluding , eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent , a cup of epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up .	114.943669123671
a move had to be made because that merry old soul , the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot , didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come , alternately racking their feelings ( the mermaids’ ) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address , as mr algebra remarks passim .	3130.528913612138
at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew .	6.77430679799155
people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep .	1.9791894564051344
the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles .	1.1974766574189875
your god was a jew .	2.398880316221616
because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrick-on-shannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo .	2.031564467242677
i propose , our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo , as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over .	1.7830126008327127
my diggings are quite close in the vicinity .	1.5185318283042388
you can’t drink that stuff .	1.549640483452626
do you like cocoa ?	1.0359566756361716
wait .	1
i’ll just pay this lot .	1.344732350318205
the best plan clearly being to clear out , the remainder being plain sailing , he beckoned , while prudently pocketing the photo , to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to .	7.144138424814491
yes , that’s the best , he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less .	4.44717531142489
all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his ( b’s ) busy brain , education ( the genuine article ), literature , journalism , prize titbits , up to date billing , concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres , turning money away , duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things , no necessity , of course , to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it , and a slice of luck .	395.92210729728987
an opening was all was wanted .	1.1796439725064116
because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well , by the way no harm , to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to .	78.9665958226532
the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy , earl cadogan , had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in london somewhere .	15.612179769923117
silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement .	1.2983424510579542
then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect .	8.980005627645982
to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why .	1.6385595643860003
give us a squint at that literature , grandfather , the ancient mariner put in , manifesting some natural impatience .	8.545795242023095
and welcome , answered the elderly party thus addressed .	1.3585729951696424
the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears .	8.661732946233059
are you bad in the eyes ?	1.4406649123381428
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried .	1.7798195037407138
why , answered the seafarer with the tartan beard , who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way , staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as , i uses goggles reading .	18.281306247694666
sand in the red sea done that .	1.203509849646286
one time i could read a book in the dark , manner of speaking .	4.264564496290639
the arabian nights entertainment was my favourite and red as a rose is she .	1.784111250134696
hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what , found drowned or the exploits of king willow , iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts , during which time ( completely regardless of ire ) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it , all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions , that is to say , either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark .	485.9303550308779
to cut a long story short bloom , grasping the situation , was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost , being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion , taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming , making a grand total of fourpence ( the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers , literally the last of the mohicans ), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures , coffee 2d , confectionery do , and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way , as wetherup used to remark .	23865.002961284128
come , he counselled to close the séance .	1.3116756832513412
seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente .	9.10251524990342
stephen , who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out , paused at the , for a moment , the door .	5.881892995488194
one thing i never understood , he said to be original on the spur of the moment .	5.430727239684829
why they put tables upside down at night , i mean chairs upside down , on the tables in cafés .	3.4299599179538323
to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation , saying straight off	1.6991225013704523
to sweep the floor in the morning .	2.097894177011909
so saying he skipped around , nimbly considering , frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right , a habit of his , by the bye , his right side being , in classical idiom , his tender achilles .	18.44447348025889
the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins .	2.9281656153860145
it will ( the air ) do you good , bloom said , meaning also the walk , in a moment .	6.236602783707815
the only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man .	1.647333701515733
come .	1
it’s not far .	1.1629536121677864
lean on me .	1.3869742589493512
accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen’s right and led him on accordingly .	2.206812267033011
yes , stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him , sinewless and wobbly and all that .	6.985862935443768
anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones , brazier etc .	2.146780364614266
where the municipal supernumerary , ex gumley , was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy , as the adage has it , dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new .	10.384520297770758
and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class , probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings .	134.70326793978768
so they turned on to chatting about music , a form of art for which bloom , as a pure amateur , possessed the greatest love , as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place .	17.41034856223518
wagnerian music , though confessedly grand in its way , was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of mercadante’s huguenots meyerbeer’s seven last words on the cross and mozart’s twelfth mass he simply revelled in , the gloria in that being , to his mind , the acme of first class music as such , literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat .	167.9836391231288
he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be .	7.804074133929237
he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossini’s stabat mater a work simply abounding in immortal numbers , in which his wife , madam marion tweedy , made a hit , a veritable sensation , he might safely say , greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade , in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper gardiner street , the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos , or virtuosi rather .	193.16401497053633
there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore .	24.82319488554974
on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha a gem in its line , he had a penchant though with only a surface knowledge , for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn .	9.253802380024768
and talking of that , taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites , he mentioned par excellence lionel’s air in martha , m’appari which , curiously enough , he had heard or overheard , to be more accurate , on yesterday , a privilege he keenly appreciated , from the lips of stephen’s respected father , sung to perfection , a study of the number , in fact , which made all the others take a back seat .	215.32237072216748
stephen , in reply to a politely put query , said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeare’s songs , at least of in or about that period , the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist , who anno ludendo hausi , doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch , whom b. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar , for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and byrd ( william ) who played the virginals , he said , in the queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull .	784.9241550118188
on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse , dragging a sweeper , paced on the paven ground , brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull .	31.52258565364156
he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk , as it struck him , the two identical names , as a striking coincidence .	9.893134928858174
by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn , which perceiving , bloom , who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual , plucked the other’s sleeve gently , jocosely remarking	5.4777853780723875
our lives are in peril tonight .	1.4724588163506946
beware of the steamroller .	1.2106235696651764
they thereupon stopped .	1.415388190847596
bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas , suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new , a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker , a hipshaker , a blackbuttocker , a taildangler , a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch , busy with his thoughts .	134.61696602296087
but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but , as he wisely reflected , you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up .	11.550182652626281
he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse , without a second care in the world .	9.746743660424242
but even a dog , he reflected , take that mongrel in barney kiernan’s , of the same size , would be a holy horror to face .	10.047616857389363
but it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel , ship of the desert , distilling grapes into potheen in his hump .	6.913865813309802
nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained , nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees .	3.5803109246219895
whale with a harpoon hairpin , alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke , chalk a circle for a rooster , tiger my eagle eye .	6.667381272404804
these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old .	7.625777731932372
what’s this i was saying ?	1.1934035649834431
ah , yes !	1.3276186679741186
my wife , he intimated , plunging in medias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind .	3.81816625735652
he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen , image of his mother , which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built .	10.624035815378859
still , supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected , it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall’s irish industries , concert on the preceding monday , and aristocracy in general .	9.815258746337603
exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by jans pieter sweelinck , a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from .	2.4141305553896872
even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens , sweet murderers of men , which boggled bloom a bit	5.9828126098675325
von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten .	1.2120589727336726
these opening bars he sang and translated extempore .	1.3496864121713221
bloom , nodding , said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did .	3.60030412743335
a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that , the rarest of boons , which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out , could easily , if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain , command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b. a. ( a huge ad in its way ) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success , being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites , if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he , a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties , hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you .	12444.506817042324
it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season , for choice , causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation , cases of which , as he happened to know , were on record in fact , without giving the show away , he himself once upon a time , if he cared to , could easily have .	1709.0815290328528
added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at , going hand in hand with his tuition fees .	4.904386436154683
not , he parenthesised , that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time .	5.868112182730161
but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped .	7.8772824253049345
besides , though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree , original music like that , different from the conventional rut , would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their genus omne .	19.528653418843472
yes , beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and , booking ahead , give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house , given a backerup , if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs , so to speak , a big if however , with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows .	4103.049399709996
and it need not detract from the other by one iota as , being his own master , he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone .	30.199105088611667
in fact , he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other , possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort , hung on to him at all .	24.273525560603073
the horse was just then .	1.2254644429382053
and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed ( bloom did ), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle , advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who , he noticed , was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present , deprecate him , or whatever you like to call it which in bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character , no pun intended .	74.00724526827278
the horse having reached the end of his tether , so to speak , halted and , rearing high a proud feathering tail , added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish , three smoking globes of turds .	55.32284260075067
slowly three times , one after another , from a full crupper he mired .	4.070129245707428
and humanely his driver waited till he ( or she ) had ended , patient in his scythed car .	2.6512133622436127
side by side bloom , profiting by the contretemps with stephen passed through the gap of the chains , divided by the upright , and , stepping over a strand of mire , went across towards gardiner street lower , stephen singing more boldly , but not loudly , the end of the ballad .	134.49411950089464
und alle schiffe brücken .	1.2106808558176954
the driver never said a word , good , bad or indifferent , but merely watched the two figures , as he sat on his lowbacked car , both black , one full , one lean , walk towards the railway bridge , to be married by father maher .	47.70609954790783
as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their tête à tête ( which , of course , he was utterly out of ) about sirens , enemies of man’s reason , mingled with a number of other topics of the same category , usurpers , historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car .	2405.928255950102
17	1
what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning ?	1.1002287712458203
starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square , west then , at reduced pace , each bearing left , gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of temple street then , at reduced pace with interruptions of halt , bearing right , temple street , north , as far as hardwicke place .	98.63136523839135
approaching , disparate , at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before george’s church diametrically , the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends .	5.710260931929155
of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary ?	1.4230912210576196
music , literature , ireland , dublin , paris , friendship , woman , prostitution , diet , the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees , exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets , the roman catholic church , ecclesiastical celibacy , the irish nation , jesuit education , careers , the study of medicine , the past day , the maleficent influence of the presabbath , stephen’s collapse .	1302.6067601429131

both were sensitive to artistic impressions , musical in preference to plastic or pictorial .	1.4453138762029163
both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life , a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence .	3.709976313582939

were their views on some points divergent ?	1.0547615861874404
stephen dissented openly from bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature .	7.991105456515803
bloom assented covertly to stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus , son of potitus , son of odyssus , sent by pope celestine i in the year 432 in the reign of leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart ( † 266 a.d. ), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree .	178.72914494393382
the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength , accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere , stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud ( perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin ) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand .	21.53779219822391
was there one point on which their views were equal and negative ?	1.122599429160621

what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884 , 1885 , 1886 , 1888 , 1892 , 1893 , 1904 did bloom make before their arrival at their destination ?	3.9997453029013035
he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations .	8.04958631003107
as in what ways ?	1.0115011063970034
from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived .	3.8600899576351915
what act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination ?	1.1910556257074234

it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding .	5.359284278065415
why was he doubly irritated ?	1.03599341289764
because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget .	2.5613459855639937
what were then the alternatives before the , premeditatedly ( respectively ) and inadvertently , keyless couple ?	2.073225603544827
to enter or not to enter .	1.5950919370152514
to knock or not to knock .	1.7734778805043283
bloom’s decision ?	1
a stratagem .	1
resting his feet on the dwarf wall , he climbed over the area railings , compressed his hat on his head , grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles , lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall .	382.13240636417913
did he fall ?	1.0157278928411209
by his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure , as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of francis froedman , pharmaceutical chemist of 19 frederick street , north , on the last feast of the ascension , to wit , the twelfth day of may of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era ( jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour , mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo ), golden number 5 , epact 13 , solar cycle 9 , dominical letters c b , roman indiction 2 , julian period 6617 , mcmiv.	1034.6241680871738
did he rise uninjured by concussion ?	1.040376013352003
regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact , raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum , gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery , ignited a lucifer match by friction , set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock , lit a high flame which , by regulating , he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle .	116.47531561148311
what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive ?	1.0769192851276277
reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 cp , a man lighting a candle of 1 cp , a man removing in turn each of his two boots , a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle .	31.37064834482688
did the man reappear elsewhere ?	1.0204464760929504
after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor .	3.1652842583143994
the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges .	1.2604697713319444
in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat , with his candle .	3.161589647012189
did stephen obey his sign ?	1.0441137182348428
yes , entering softly , he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of bloom’s house .	17.764244937082914
what did bloom do ?	1.1391736861024961
he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame , drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone , one for stephen with its back to the area window , the other for himself when necessary , knelt on one knee , composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs flower and m’donald of 14 d’olier street , kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match , thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air .	868.4757603345591
of what similar apparitions did stephen think ?	1.0808747536973033
of others elsewhere in other times who , kneeling on one knee or on two , had kindled fires for him , of brother michael in the infirmary of the college of the society of jesus at clongowes wood , sallins , in the county of kildare of his father , simon dedalus , in an unfurnished room of his first residence in dublin , number thirteen fitzgibbon street of his godmother miss kate morkan in the house of her dying sister miss julia morkan at 15 usher’s island of his aunt sara , wife of richie ( richard ) goulding , in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 clanbrassil street of his mother mary , wife of simon dedalus , in the kitchen of number twelve north richmond street on the morning of the feast of saint francis xavier 1898 of the dean of studies , father butt , in the physics’ theatre of university college , 16 stephen’s green , north of his sister dilly ( delia ) in his father’s house in cabra .	594743.7751402728
what did stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall ?	7.449258233459407
under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope , stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier , from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction .	75.80421372199405
what did bloom see on the range ?	1.453948700026011
on the right ( smaller ) hob a blue enamelled saucepan on the left ( larger ) hob a black iron kettle .	1.8122213396176705
what did bloom do at the range ?	1.4423244923194711
he removed the saucepan to the left hob , rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow .	7.244013908133976
did it flow ?	1.0092663701449276
yes .	1
from roundwood reservoir in county wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons , percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the dargle , rathdown , glen of the downs and callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at stillorgan , a distance of 22 statute miles , and thence , through a system of relieving tanks , by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at eustace bridge , upper leeson street , though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1 / 2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer , mr spencer harty , c. e. , on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption ( envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the grand and royal canals as in 1893 ) particularly as the south dublin guardians , notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter , had been convicted of a wastage of 20 , 000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation , mr ignatius rice , solicitor , thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public , selfsupporting taxpayers , solvent , sound .	652785.2708058492

having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals , why did he return to the stillflowing tap ?	3.6122923787522154
to wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of barrington’s lemonflavoured soap , to which paper still adhered , ( bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for ), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them , face and hands , in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller .	11.602011174176008
what reason did stephen give for declining bloom’s offer ?	1.03443518095056
that he was hydrophobe , hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water , ( his last bath having taken place in the month of october of the preceding year ), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal , distrusting aquacities of thought and language .	15.104392968828
what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing , the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape , stomach and thenar or sole of foot ?	123.42100856400728

what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress ?	1.2496098242174776
dietary concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon , salt ling and butter , the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed .	24.079957207248512
which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest ?	1.8538787820633913
confidence in himself , an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation .	1.9412296027390696

the phenomenon of ebullition .	1.210637166132273
fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue , ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal , containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun , primal source of heat ( radiant ), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether .	23.080666663732337
heat ( convected ), a mode of motion developed by such combustion , was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel , being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron , in part reflected , in part absorbed , in part transmitted , gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point , a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° fahrenheit .	368.37561235159654

meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipient lunation , approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way , discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of sirius ( alpha in canis maior ) 10 lightyears ( 57 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 miles ) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet of arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901 of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars , in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years , threescore and ten , of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity .	6084.924347042525
were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast ?	1.106818970867581
of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth , beneath removable stones , in hives and mounds , of microbes , germs , bacteria , bacilli , spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies , themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies , each , in continuity , its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies , dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till , if the progress were carried far enough , nought nowhere was never reached .	1791.9418116528166
why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result ?	1.5788949629851563
because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places , e.g. , the 9th power of the 9th power of 9 , that , the result having been obtained , 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units , tens , hundreds , thousands , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , millions , tens of millions , hundreds of millions , billions , the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers .	27898.10691761051

conscious that the human organism , normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons , when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity , according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage , impeded respiration and vertigo , when proposing this problem for solution , he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian , mercurial , veneral , jovian , saturnian , neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions , though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities , to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity .	864.9983379271653

was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle ?	2.190519893316196

yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2 / 6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they	4.51912244749837e+96
theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give 9 points in 10 to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1 / 4 after 3 when i saw the 2 dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never

my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little chits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g 8th bn 2nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11 / 6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6 / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more i have of life up to 35 no im what am i at all ill be 33 in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street 1st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were	6.712419192759861e+111

beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time

down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at la linea when that matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of

the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord lytton eugene aram molly bawn she gave me by mrs hungerford on account

is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when i was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along i suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few i posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes i could fight with my nails listening to that old arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in holles street the nurse was after when i put on my gloves and hat at the window to show i was going out not a notion what i meant arent they thick never understand

where does their great intelligence come in id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the city arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear madam only his letter

mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace

clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from africa and that derelict ship that

that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop i took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat i couldnt smell anything off it im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue i hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night i couldnt rest easy in my bed in gibraltar even getting up to see why am i so damned nervous about that though i like it in the winter its more company o lord it was rotten cold too that winter when i was only about ten was i yes i had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift i had up to heat myself i loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and i in my skin hopping around i used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance i put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow i hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and findon haddy and hot buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their claws i wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as i wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice i bought i think ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it friday yes i will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the london and newcastle williams and woods goes twice as far only for the bones i hate those eels cod yes ill get a nice piece of cod im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5 / - each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who mrs fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow i hate those ruck of mary ann coalboxes out for the day whit monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation i wonder what kind is that book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose ill have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore	1.557771388245877e+84
who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about 3 weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5 / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweet heart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 i was married 88 milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at dillons 5 or 6 about 88 i suppose hes 20 or more im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in 1 / 2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though	7.290127251341544e+74
no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only 8 / 6 or 18 / 6 ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want £ 1 or perhaps 30 / - ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if i can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only i only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as i can get up early ill go to lambes there beside findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today i mean no no fridays an unlucky day first i want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it i think while im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes i can accompany him first i must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll i wear shall i wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in liptons i love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 1 / 2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table id get that cheaper in wait wheres this i saw them not long ago i love flowers id love to have the whole place swimming in roses god of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got him to propose to me yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath yes he said i was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes
