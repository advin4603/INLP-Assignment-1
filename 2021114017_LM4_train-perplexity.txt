stately , plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed .	352.0841541279043
a yellow dressinggown , ungirdled , was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air .	25.923778590539595
he held the bowl aloft and intoned	2.9298072118367022
introibo ad altare dei .	1.3208295430368364
halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely	16.12764117842056
come up , kinch !	1.986028766411998
come up , you fearful jesuit !	2.6667481978299477
solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest .	7.814340500888789
he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower , the surrounding land and the awaking mountains .	32.43721959112923
then , catching sight of stephen dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head .	1035.2124007844532
stephen dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak .	59785.38598249801
buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly .	22.73305654465519
back to barracks !	1.2121254964161197
he said sternly .	1.184806972062791
he added in a preacher’s tone	1.950024532641371
for this , o dearly beloved , is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns .	35.452387128461105
slow music , please .	1.7435266903193953
shut your eyes , gents .	2.413973891049312
one moment .	1
a little trouble about those white corpuscles .	3.1653370609337
silence , all .	1.4002724031727176
he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points .	1512.2866209373851
chrysostomos .	1
two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm .	3.9742059064978204
thanks , old chap , he cried briskly .	5.940366173956294
that will do nicely .	1.558550541225699
switch off the current , will you ?	2.880150614601799
he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher , gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown .	245.49887211948962
the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages .	40.53799055260892
a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips .	3.8345588941226696
the mockery of it !	1.571350464571731
he said gaily .	1.1034687911830832
your absurd name , an ancient greek !	4.020735876293863
he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself .	73.89478176291985
stephen dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .	21516.935999076857
buck mulligan’s gay voice went on .	2.8146318767949396
my name is absurd too malachi mulligan , two dactyls .	7.293384957432055
but it has a hellenic ring , hasn’t it ?	5.047394272483201
tripping and sunny like the buck himself .	3.4553364874432804
we must go to athens .	2.172569757126204
will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ?	27.59871390549873
he laid the brush aside and , laughing with delight , cried	14.510258560659459
will he come ?	1.162085880538292
the jejune jesuit !	1.1832710669858146
ceasing , he began to shave with care .	5.125428269969875
tell me , mulligan , stephen said quietly .	3.642800513779728
yes , my love ?	2.0285754510803105
how long is haines going to stay in this tower ?	7.9792699648900935
buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder .	7.238981923696794
god , isn’t he dreadful ?	2.3638111215685353
he said frankly .	1.2043377977301029
a ponderous saxon .	1.1919481431085317
he thinks you’re not a gentleman .	2.616660214638051
god , these bloody english !	2.110746783764661
bursting with money and indigestion .	2.054519102932332
because he comes from oxford .	2.066114832306207
you know , dedalus , you have the real oxford manner .	10.95495072265257
he can’t make you out .	2.5381462391525016
o , my name for you is the best kinch , the knife-blade .	21.08718794211077
he shaved warily over his chin .	2.6584536288308653
he was raving all night about a black panther , stephen said .	16.18700674089111
where is his guncase ?	1.5796869471287596
a woful lunatic !	1.2121254964161197
mulligan said .	1
were you in a funk ?	2.3935482940957513
i was , stephen said with energy and growing fear .	5.239281145488156
out here in the dark with a man i don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther .	119.01784661640977
you saved men from drowning .	1.9987076727999638
i’m not a hero , however .	3.11092903567855
if he stays on here i am off .	4.290573689941432
buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade .	6.5666497672493245
he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily .	16.054964705600987
scutter !	1
he cried thickly .	1.1947002156310034
he came over to the gunrest and , thrusting a hand into stephen’s upper pocket , said	40.136633587305944
lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor .	7.84320500414871
stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief .	91.45423988181398
buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly .	2.6125210683386686
then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said	4.202471344514847
the bard’s noserag !	1.183170611214717
a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen .	5.919419068173756
you can almost taste it , can’t you ?	5.82545194318024
he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly .	89.79199657403142
god !	1
he said quietly .	1.2052155151145412
isn’t the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother ?	10.450153471105551
the snotgreen sea .	1.1820617921933374
the scrotumtightening sea .	1.1820617921933374
epi oinopa ponton .	1.286380070946558
ah , dedalus , the greeks !	3.5080816689193375
i must teach you .	1.5934734297403488
you must read them in the original .	3.8775505957897725
thalatta !	1
thalatta !	1
she is our great sweet mother .	2.9439299853231446
come and look .	1.375860435036434
stephen stood up and went over to the parapet .	7.923557300460834
leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown .	62.11024130279763
our mighty mother !	1.4174233043827724
buck mulligan said .	1.2473661348490819
he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen’s face .	17.806493177472213
the aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said .	5.714347257100707
that’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you .	20.040078349917486
someone killed her , stephen said gloomily .	2.473116207045937
you could have knelt down , damn it , kinch , when your dying mother asked you , buck mulligan said .	152.39089159416307
i’m hyperborean as much as you .	2.694977296264224
but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her .	130.3290700681015
and you refused .	1.0770038823889205
there is something sinister in you... .	2.2460031316733526
he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek .	7.069024848108089
a tolerant smile curled his lips .	2.3664074634978833
but a lovely mummer !	1.6359340051973752
he murmured to himself .	1.6478017127107303
kinch , the loveliest mummer of them all !	3.8325164969351797
he shaved evenly and with care , in silence , seriously .	11.901574029674633
stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve .	466.61073222544564
pain , that was not yet the pain of love , fretted his heart .	23.024225221736547
silently , in a dream she had come to him after her death , her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , that had bent upon him , mute , reproachful , a faint odour of wetted ashes .	47910.341284809576
across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him .	62.25292158678462
the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid .	16.839175054961938
a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting .	774.998532913868
buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade .	2.7013831797720465
ah , poor dogsbody !	1.3807033958981876
he said in a kind voice .	3.330774228008108
i must give you a shirt and a few noserags .	8.804646967522201
how are the secondhand breeks ?	1.9325721170255767
they fit well enough , stephen answered .	4.575525174064744
buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip .	4.082380053786587
the mockery of it , he said contentedly .	2.5197491455875682
secondleg they should be .	1.8648670188119283
god knows what poxy bowsy left them off .	3.6344916969506365
i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey .	8.86058841725164
you’ll look spiffing in them .	1.9794647600510782
i’m not joking , kinch .	1.9734171928516042
you look damn well when you’re dressed .	3.5197867177723317
thanks , stephen said .	1.6747148858615735
i can’t wear them if they are grey .	5.41856776436562
he can’t wear them , buck mulligan told his face in the mirror .	22.344691211132496
etiquette is etiquette .	1.1751800344309515
he kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers .	9.410521437506835
he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin .	19.980193654166744
stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes .	45.80288457681101
that fellow i was with in the ship last night , said buck mulligan , says you have g .	107.63469062178214
p .	1
i .	1
he’s up in dottyville with connolly norman .	2.64524754027598
general paralysis of the insane !	1.9138092774976092
he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea .	143.29670149714534
his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth .	15.436140029187206
laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk .	2.862427769002234
look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard !	6.611155300318749
stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack .	90.27391566971814
hair on end .	1.3078678128448007
as he and others see me .	3.577539949783283
who chose this face for me ?	2.8445666643504315
this dogsbody to rid of vermin .	2.1622937116571967
it asks me too .	1.659978760065788
i pinched it out of the skivvy’s room , buck mulligan said .	7.086706018614222
it does her all right .	2.135264184495451
the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi .	3.1241524184111364
lead him not into temptation .	1.9207256853791341
and her name is ursula .	2.2683435543715142
laughing again , he brought the mirror away from stephen’s peering eyes .	16.19238537290676
the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said .	35.75523010207353
if wilde were only alive to see you !	4.4912646729732035
drawing back and pointing , stephen said with bitterness	3.6766249825587867
it is a symbol of irish art .	2.7659245001492687
the cracked lookingglass of a servant .	1.9713376200505073
buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen’s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them .	1599.4854300307122
it’s not fair to tease you like that , kinch , is it ?	13.731596683375116
he said kindly .	1.0813384777280388
god knows you have more spirit than any of them .	9.635591148104828
parried again .	1
he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his .	17.683012038202378
the cold steel pen .	1.491064883518487
cracked lookingglass of a servant !	1.8171700895829408
tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea .	15.522517275962633
he’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman .	7.3182891486317585
his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other .	33.49416438535679
god , kinch , if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island .	113.51879962050855
hellenise it .	1
cranly’s arm .	1
his arm .	1
and to think of your having to beg from these swine .	11.783969164044613
i’m the only one that knows what you are .	10.251001619829065
why don’t you trust me more ?	3.300977175538148
what have you up your nose against me ?	5.568156134945473
is it haines ?	1.237768974193843
if he makes any noise here i’ll bring down seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe .	86.47456023588653
young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe’s rooms .	3.6595803674534695
palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter , one clasping another .	8.900783338240709
o , i shall expire !	1.9665899405020957
break the news to her gently , aubrey !	4.3512778546285436
i shall die !	1.2347386340674307
with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by ades of magdalen with the tailor’s shears .	1511.1130176101055
a scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade .	2.4606528720623544
i don’t want to be debagged !	2.6442690409237963
don’t you play the giddy ox with me !	4.955548239462166
shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle .	7.0290748478117795
a deaf gardener , aproned , masked with matthew arnold’s face , pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms .	108.18758076958814
to ourselves.. .	1
new paganism.. .	1
omphalos .	1
let him stay , stephen said .	2.717567411682567
there’s nothing wrong with him except at night .	3.9547547404633776
then what is it ?	1.6981784721750939
buck mulligan asked impatiently .	1.5971066171258868
cough it up .	1.4422921389419419
i’m quite frank with you .	2.032864277261509
what have you against me now ?	3.0636795486951938
they halted , looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale .	240.42830921395756
stephen freed his arm quietly .	2.083452733733122
do you wish me to tell you ?	4.7844445307337855
he asked .	1
yes , what is it ?	2.504286153296885
buck mulligan answered .	1.2807546288790368
i don’t remember anything .	1.6520759669728804
he looked in stephen’s face as he spoke .	6.180669855731329
a light wind passed his brow , fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes .	125.99103418439952
stephen , depressed by his own voice , said	4.724063613205583
do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother’s death ?	43.335474635804644
buck mulligan frowned quickly and said	2.4546942429762058
what ?	1
where ?	1
i can’t remember anything .	1.4132884242478814
i remember only ideas and sensations .	2.2061779283089398
why ?	1
what happened in the name of god ?	3.5573241066089736
you were making tea , stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water .	49.78518636998988
your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom .	6.469802034434352
she asked you who was in your room .	6.545234889480053
yes ?	1
buck mulligan said .	1.2473661348490819
what did i say ?	1.997038261389144
i forget .	1
you said , stephen answered , o , it’s only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead .	31.732816559871168
a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan’s cheek .	21.881042269583865
did i say that ?	2.0092516757802836
he asked .	1
well ?	1
what harm is that ?	1.6980924142647023
he shook his constraint from him nervously .	3.0900154585195585
and what is death , he asked , your mother’s or yours or my own ?	42.08724291346923
you saw only your mother die .	2.528850496001298
i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom .	78.30808432024617
it’s a beastly thing and nothing else .	3.2778028443506684
it simply doesn’t matter .	1.4935455914063491
you wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you .	49.695559985929904
why ?	1
because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you , only it’s injected the wrong way .	34.74117349869319
to me it’s all a mockery and beastly .	4.422000546015642
her cerebral lobes are not functioning .	2.416856319122622
she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt .	10.784167929718828
humour her till it’s over .	2.0318096133561596
you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don’t whinge like some hired mute from lalouette’s .	165.36382246055493
absurd !	1
i suppose i did say it .	3.243462451823761
i didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother .	7.732567005938485
he had spoken himself into boldness .	2.255755846970352
stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly	58.27914794011934
i am not thinking of the offence to my mother .	9.178665993050826
of what then ?	1.1216342101955579
buck mulligan asked .	1.3425897113947753
of the offence to me , stephen answered .	6.994750925420119
buck mulligan swung round on his heel .	3.759015196398495
o , an impossible person !	2.090013082639316
he exclaimed .	1
he walked off quickly round the parapet .	3.45727806029107
stephen stood at his post , gazing over the calm sea towards the headland .	22.106351476146404
sea and headland now grew dim .	2.229320753332826
pulses were beating in his eyes , veiling their sight , and he felt the fever of his cheeks .	69.57316910607739
a voice within the tower called loudly	2.9438057535246878
are you up there , mulligan ?	3.7343577092077926
i’m coming , buck mulligan answered .	2.27233312909397
he turned towards stephen and said	2.581167689680321
look at the sea .	1.5425424959215701
what does it care about offences ?	2.643627616384326
chuck loyola , kinch , and come on down .	6.622373397876371
the sassenach wants his morning rashers .	2.232354732485993
his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase , level with the roof	104.1354765591546
don’t mope over it all day , he said .	7.982220222387047
i’m inconsequent .	1
give up the moody brooding .	1.8958352068774798
his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead	10.855630668273529
and no more turn aside and brood upon love’s bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars .	22.666599686651463
woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed .	29.18615107179968
inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened , spurned by lightshod hurrying feet .	22.478929611999625
white breast of the dim sea .	2.9011623380391036
the twining stresses , two by two .	2.715827727266666
a hand plucking the harpstrings , merging their twining chords .	4.053153290540119
wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide .	4.052807274942839
a cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green .	24.19351248457109
it lay beneath him , a bowl of bitter waters .	7.1112486748215415
fergus’ song i sang it alone in the house , holding down the long dark chords .	33.752307633770734
her door was open she wanted to hear my music .	9.201592700673404
silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside .	7.060369177456883
she was crying in her wretched bed .	3.2045176406211415
for those words , stephen love’s bitter mystery .	5.224938068114693
where now ?	1
her secrets old featherfans , tasselled dancecards , powdered with musk , a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer .	42.31693470947275
a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl .	33.86166446217506
she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang	33.887692628795016
i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility .	4.402377204384304
phantasmal mirth , folded away muskperfumed .	2.273346479591227
and no more turn aside and brood .	2.644832822993875
folded away in the memory of nature with her toys .	6.455991376709362
memories beset his brooding brain .	1.705187320631157
her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament .	25.18381215774505
a cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening .	86.15949041678161
her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts .	13.156671786587728
in a dream , silently , she had come to him , her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , bent over him with mute secret words , a faint odour of wetted ashes .	14746.714251766934
her glazing eyes , staring out of death , to shake and bend my soul .	40.71249156011206
on me alone .	1.3211760972527415
the ghostcandle to light her agony .	2.439075539111661
ghostly light on the tortured face .	2.654030137782544
her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror , while all prayed on their knees .	24.344981875747052
her eyes on me to strike me down .	6.6010167651723695
liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat .	4.628932777979331
ghoul !	1
chewer of corpses !	1.202559951930371
no , mother !	1.3785576099423715
let me be and let me live .	4.696204334379316
kinch ahoy !	1
buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower .	5.486325308545118
it came nearer up the staircase , calling again .	7.67608712836806
stephen , still trembling at his soul’s cry , heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words .	94.67138908493
dedalus , come down , like a good mosey .	7.930731585783172
breakfast is ready .	1.1209736435330113
haines is apologising for waking us last night .	3.3992250019519017
it’s all right .	1.3702802995872312
i’m coming , stephen said , turning .	3.7762206665616134
do , for jesus’ sake , buck mulligan said .	4.7060709763963455
for my sake and for all our sakes .	5.441740859532499
his head disappeared and reappeared .	1.7403193262122554
i told him your symbol of irish art .	4.026432248403879
he says it’s very clever .	1.9982376134597157
touch him for a quid , will you ?	4.169057147333011
a guinea , i mean .	2.8374342046090373
i get paid this morning , stephen said .	4.48771219317497
the school kip ?	1.3224678919226494
buck mulligan said .	1.2473661348490819
how much ?	1
four quid ?	1
lend us one .	1.3275903482380584
if you want it , stephen said .	4.49345204625277
four shining sovereigns , buck mulligan cried with delight .	3.609199578312343
we’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids .	5.115368138214263
four omnipotent sovereigns .	1.1013591980467947
he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs , singing out of tune with a cockney accent	73.82521132342902
o , won’t we have a merry time , drinking whisky , beer and wine !	24.01025388762687
on coronation , coronation day !	1.6513106399018576
o , won’t we have a merry time on coronation day !	7.8853888461418045
warm sunshine merrying over the sea .	2.719310444412044
the nickel shavingbowl shone , forgotten , on the parapet .	6.570159343636508
why should i bring it down ?	3.433349237316785
or leave it there all day , forgotten friendship ?	7.362564408753429
he went over to it , held it in his hands awhile , feeling its coolness , smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck .	1542.2429998405935
so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes .	6.791642439442012
i am another now and yet the same .	5.496402589000351
a servant too .	1.1797422431430973
a server of a servant .	2.509499814960928
in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow .	306.3869869693405
two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated , turning .	1420.5295731364065
we’ll be choked , buck mulligan said .	2.7132446190467023
haines , open that door , will you ?	4.4826637718033036
stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker .	2.936286531073969
a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting , went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors .	352.32139085970783
have you the key ?	1.6384417989890117
a voice asked .	1.4004038421018734
dedalus has it , buck mulligan said .	3.068698736385685
janey mack , i’m choked !	2.1325922493308562
he howled , without looking up from the fire	5.159827529043305
kinch !	1
it’s in the lock , stephen said , coming forward .	9.325629271846468
the key scraped round harshly twice and , when the heavy door had been set ajar , welcome light and bright air entered .	208.43160455860598
haines stood at the doorway , looking out .	5.387688597363375
stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait .	14.381625402577662
buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him .	9.065980801257465
then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table , set them down heavily and sighed with relief .	210.6595907891004
i’m melting , he said , as the candle remarked when.. .	6.418022295820917
but , hush !	1.194963324001769
not a word more on that subject !	4.071620442491193
kinch , wake up !	1.632832732982785
bread , butter , honey .	2.261462577430206
haines , come in .	1.837424153891663
the grub is ready .	1.3906034215160965
bless us , o lord , and these thy gifts .	7.959544902237605
where’s the sugar ?	1.3612953963366394
o , jay , there’s no milk .	3.6018357809924844
stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker .	29.197352029763483
buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet .	5.354541223232174
what sort of a kip is this ?	3.3753912632329977
he said .	1
i told her to come after eight .	4.258681052767568
we can drink it black , stephen said thirstily .	4.052140909456463
there’s a lemon in the locker .	2.3768336022335137
o , damn you and your paris fads !	5.2341297668471345
buck mulligan said .	1.2473661348490819
i want sandycove milk .	1.4318420058557035
haines came in from the doorway and said quietly	5.290337462395949
that woman is coming up with the milk .	6.710638178601121
the blessings of god on you !	3.038011211649077
buck mulligan cried , jumping up from his chair .	7.033875956102392
sit down .	1
pour out the tea there .	2.265961496731986
the sugar is in the bag .	2.975111034259824
here , i can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs .	7.664709734936168
he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates , saying	41.66885799211233
in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti .	2.4195837684292227
haines sat down to pour out the tea .	5.775145642875136
i’m giving you two lumps each , he said .	6.861097279098944
but , i say , mulligan , you do make strong tea , don’t you ?	27.187598548255263
buck mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old woman’s wheedling voice	45.16944213289563
when i makes tea i makes tea , as old mother grogan said .	29.989613502057768
and when i makes water i makes water .	6.906017675325744
by jove , it is tea , haines said .	6.16936469939839
buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling	2.5226856112029057
so i do , mrs cahill says she .	5.7134224098409865
begob , ma’am says mrs cahill , god send you don’t make them in the one pot .	52.383723585219435
he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled on his knife .	35.012290244421244
that’s folk , he said very earnestly , for your book , haines .	18.04106594659016
five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum .	31.70493698823186
printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind .	14.89175798076247
he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice , lifting his brows	33.4452211325062
can you recall , brother , is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads ?	148.60157225248543
i doubt it , said stephen gravely .	3.8706064535401326
do you now ?	1.2747145188787437
buck mulligan said in the same tone .	3.964388894411204
your reasons , pray ?	1.7395509136873901
i fancy , stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion .	39.064994876475346
mother grogan was , one imagines , a kinswoman of mary ann .	11.266697820209224
buck mulligan’s face smiled with delight .	2.505211843669902
charming !	1
he said in a finical sweet voice , showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly .	50.21252142042655
do you think she was ?	2.2606918311173474
quite charming !	1
then , suddenly overclouding all his features , he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf	113.88917327858964
for old mary ann	1.233756748756333
she doesn’t care a damn .	2.199549651844922
but , hising up her petticoats.. .	2.3826958737236628
he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned .	7.049162211492905
the doorway was darkened by an entering form .	3.8780679711855033
the milk , sir !	2.013061821065058
come in , ma’am , mulligan said .	4.3423186560256815
kinch , get the jug .	2.641238018413172
an old woman came forward and stood by stephen’s elbow .	10.25523219633133
that’s a lovely morning , sir , she said .	5.440357898270882
glory be to god .	1.699984284812815
to whom ?	1
mulligan said , glancing at her .	3.5340496651094737
ah , to be sure !	2.5446507265480443
stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker .	6.435073912656166
the islanders , mulligan said to haines casually , speak frequently of the collector of prepuces .	41.80077368839276
how much , sir ?	1.912361249053472
asked the old woman .	1.8388496231300415
a quart , stephen said .	2.4191387877546306
he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk , not hers .	61.21501544684467
old shrunken paps .	1.1751800344309515
she poured again a measureful and a tilly .	3.7301453031035527
old and secret she had entered from a morning world , maybe a messenger .	21.13357692128827
she praised the goodness of the milk , pouring it out .	13.084760778376111
crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field , a witch on her toadstool , her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs .	251.36636976557395
they lowed about her whom they knew , dewsilky cattle .	8.028060035046241
silk of the kine and poor old woman , names given her in old times .	37.68284141566183
a wandering crone , lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer , their common cuckquean , a messenger from the secret morning .	310.5891824971507
to serve or to upbraid , whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour .	42.39087079562713
it is indeed , ma’am , buck mulligan said , pouring milk into their cups .	26.77573191773462
taste it , sir , she said .	3.457573118991067
he drank at her bidding .	2.113420137878153
if we could live on good food like that , he said to her somewhat loudly , we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts .	749.6814015503214
living in a bogswamp , eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust , horsedung and consumptives’ spits .	38.810706561031594
are you a medical student , sir ?	3.9843230608433533
the old woman asked .	1.4322410464467743
i am , ma’am , buck mulligan answered .	3.6875153772036815
look at that now , she said .	4.353813357403711
stephen listened in scornful silence .	1.8925327081100893
she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly , her bonesetter , her medicineman me she slights .	165.24982567402472
to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins , of man’s flesh made not in god’s likeness , the serpent’s prey .	5627.484578871578
and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes .	24.176373954174295
do you understand what he says ?	3.5919468106994774
stephen asked her .	1.33144518561017
is it french you are talking , sir ?	5.288243778539875
the old woman said to haines .	3.910819801996186
haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently .	8.839129828606183
irish , buck mulligan said .	1.7951513468579996
is there gaelic on you ?	2.090981575363976
i thought it was irish , she said , by the sound of it .	25.714234605940664
are you from the west , sir ?	5.072209211359169
i am an englishman , haines answered .	3.592843466711248
he’s english , buck mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland .	30.742674608532997
sure we ought to , the old woman said , and i’m ashamed i don’t speak the language myself .	94.27662358904365
i’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows .	8.678656236145066
grand is no name for it , said buck mulligan .	9.872161275337795
wonderful entirely .	1
fill us out some more tea , kinch .	5.944327625425636
would you like a cup , ma’am ?	5.035813897421779
no , thank you , sir , the old woman said , slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go .	545.1514349444979
haines said to her	1.3723002169880243
have you your bill ?	1.7852856984542658
we had better pay her , mulligan , hadn’t we ?	8.06066835188987
stephen filled again the three cups .	2.8190550243013934
bill , sir ?	1.3751526806677428
she said , halting .	1.3290285027785815
well , it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling .	2195.350375418443
that’s a shilling and one and two is two and two , sir .	34.56585309692574
buck mulligan sighed and , having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides , stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets .	1160.0535792550952
pay up and look pleasant , haines said to him , smiling .	14.743876920233092
stephen filled a third cup , a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk .	35.284686142765594
buck mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried	31.889563668717823
a miracle !	1
he passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying	12.50716601573248
ask nothing more of me , sweet .	4.600023008955304
all i can give you i give .	4.688732871372081
stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand .	4.487310240286836
we’ll owe twopence , he said .	2.580258818731669
time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin .	11.19680510285506
time enough .	1
good morning , sir .	2.027140892325494
she curtseyed and went out , followed by buck mulligan’s tender chant	12.316952796435244
heart of my heart , were it more ,	7.1235192904148725
more would be laid at your feet .	3.9845532625245244
he turned to stephen and said	2.610466250773905
seriously , dedalus .	1.3887832947133774
i’m stony .	1
hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money .	14.704534102525836
today the bards must drink and junket .	2.760000124369585
ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty .	12.298394502146774
that reminds me , haines said , rising , that i have to visit your national library today .	81.39860052396821
our swim first , buck mulligan said .	3.0928389512607906
he turned to stephen and asked blandly	3.8724402446812216
is this the day for your monthly wash , kinch ?	9.654628027015134
then he said to haines	2.031310366933656
the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month .	11.524653095654793
all ireland is washed by the gulfstream , stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf .	57.70385597559056
haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke	60.520908744861956
i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me .	22.09966491179526
speaking to me .	1.4314604530116588
they wash and tub and scrub .	2.432500797061051
agenbite of inwit .	1.262630577500867
conscience .	1
yet here’s a spot .	1.6182470404452667
that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good .	26.210012007841428
buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone	20.097231167411564
wait till you hear him on hamlet , haines .	10.762477687069143
well , i mean it , haines said , still speaking to stephen .	14.619891818296924
i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in .	24.74834410036099
would i make any money by it ?	3.536648941499611
stephen asked .	1
haines laughed and , as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock , said	64.28477775320651
i don’t know , i’m sure .	3.8168622523116214
he strolled out to the doorway .	3.633711172125385
buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour	13.044611097552405
you put your hoof in it now .	3.942464395970588
what did you say that for ?	3.7564037666410464
well ?	1
stephen said .	1
the problem is to get money .	3.1644267019684063
from whom ?	1
from the milkwoman or from him .	2.3687470202625396
it’s a toss up , i think .	4.188051871453852
i blow him out about you , buck mulligan said , and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes .	446.09220836685
i see little hope , stephen said , from her or from him .	17.628705382783643
buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen’s arm .	12.672948555227084
from me , kinch , he said .	3.5469057703480336
in a suddenly changed tone he added	2.536040420735071
to tell you the god’s truth i think you’re right .	9.772892704122192
damn all else they are good for .	3.9402480619555083
why don’t you play them as i do ?	6.703974213573588
to hell with them all .	2.8181528131910856
let us get out of the kip .	2.8266937557860263
he stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly	25.416174357684874
mulligan is stripped of his garments .	2.757214529138508
he emptied his pockets on to the table .	5.64569989207351
there’s your snotrag , he said .	2.502553624382575
and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them , chiding them , and to his dangling watchchain .	187.8227075091404
his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief .	25.303260229087165
god , we’ll simply have to dress the character .	5.917222655613287
i want puce gloves and green boots .	3.4347096746327512
contradiction .	1
do i contradict myself ?	1.5244328595857022
very well then , i contradict myself .	3.866219925711871
mercurial malachi .	1
a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands .	4.634528325411162
and there’s your latin quarter hat , he said .	7.0274650862527075
stephen picked it up and put it on .	5.621715703896146
haines called to them from the doorway	3.6601948526250228
are you coming , you fellows ?	3.521724646227808
i’m ready , buck mulligan answered , going towards the door .	10.072528235764489
come out , kinch .	1.8723883760314353
you have eaten all we left , i suppose .	6.226477469246032
resigned he passed out with grave words and gait , saying , wellnigh with sorrow	27.096593558471394
and going forth he met butterly .	2.501101123935616
stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it .	2297.342610099542
he put the huge key in his inner pocket .	7.53695682529117
at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked	4.544549909132848
did you bring the key ?	2.434360199890634
i have it , stephen said , preceding them .	4.60784745887707
he walked on .	1.4178253192847772
behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses .	47.74466378313731
down , sir !	1.4065505137553238
how dare you , sir !	1.9231876209100014
haines asked	1
do you pay rent for this tower ?	3.609499274094403
twelve quid , buck mulligan said .	2.4075047201566546
to the secretary of state for war , stephen added over his shoulder .	14.792236515268115
they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last	7.592149017379092
rather bleak in wintertime , i should say .	4.97757704004581
martello you call it ?	1.864711515267688
billy pitt had them built , buck mulligan said , when the french were on the sea .	35.52071680242054
but ours is the omphalos .	1.932632330343738
what is your idea of hamlet ?	3.200469328771151
haines asked stephen .	1.156485434963738
no , no , buck mulligan shouted in pain .	3.8078123226606193
i’m not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up .	43.789004387427035
wait till i have a few pints in me first .	8.609572704556323
he turned to stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat	49.68361949471686
you couldn’t manage it under three pints , kinch , could you ?	14.673189182390956
it has waited so long , stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer .	14.868247842990835
you pique my curiosity , haines said amiably .	3.2568237693113433
is it some paradox ?	1.5385776591367233
pooh !	1
buck mulligan said .	1.2473661348490819
we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes .	3.9227703381272456
it’s quite simple .	1.2246899140139147
he proves by algebra that hamlet’s grandson is shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father .	112.21130293247641
what ?	1
haines said , beginning to point at stephen .	3.464345320382435
he himself ?	1
buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to stephen’s ear	108.55999888158647
o , shade of kinch the elder !	3.285491976919396
japhet in search of a father !	3.259042317346315
we’re always tired in the morning , stephen said to haines .	8.38217535137323
and it is rather long to tell .	4.217085742995296
buck mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands .	11.42030994038776
the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus , he said .	13.822508388559132
i mean to say , haines explained to stephen as they followed , this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore .	361.107590207903
that beetles o’er his base into the sea isn’t it ?	6.005954314205882
buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak .	17.03527236202115
in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires .	59.495371630383175
it’s a wonderful tale , haines said , bringing them to halt again .	13.748986351390391
eyes , pale as the sea the wind had freshened , paler , firm and prudent .	29.244221949019803
the seas’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins .	1721.5658523930445
i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere , he said bemused .	8.106813131342067
the father and the son idea .	3.1807440398994613
the son striving to be atoned with the father .	5.4162795936056805
buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face .	8.84516072710217
he looked at them , his wellshaped mouth open happily , his eyes , from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense , blinking with mad gaiety .	671.7315897497639
he moved a doll’s head to and fro , the brims of his panama hat quivering , and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice	324.129006483773
i’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard .	6.628839273768106
my mother’s a jew , my father’s a bird .	6.2329283548468934
with joseph the joiner i cannot agree .	3.1989761640123016
so here’s to disciples and calvary .	2.0811942514823047
he held up a forefinger of warning .	4.254641631073285
if anyone thinks that i amn’t divine he’ll get no free drinks when i’m making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again .	5242.319694825489
he tugged swiftly at stephen’s ashplant in farewell and , running forward to a brow of the cliff , fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air , and chanted	12437.640465005788
goodbye , now , goodbye !	1.915955363152649
write down all i said and tell tom , dick and harry i rose from the dead .	49.12995040321243
what’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivet’s breezy.. .	11.697349089426393
goodbye , now , goodbye !	1.915955363152649
he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole , fluttering his winglike hands , leaping nimbly , mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries .	1620.017793019601
haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside stephen and said	18.57245777557153
we oughtn’t to laugh , i suppose .	4.955015539884607
he’s rather blasphemous .	1.1150300427930042
i’m not a believer myself , that is to say .	13.82449706337297
still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn’t it ?	8.338573681698394
what did he call it ?	2.18899866421645
joseph the joiner ?	1.432729441971155
the ballad of joking jesus , stephen answered .	4.773098405560241
o , haines said , you have heard it before ?	8.893323310544828
three times a day , after meals , stephen said drily .	5.5884718722125015
you’re not a believer , are you ?	4.818165763910648
haines asked .	1
i mean , a believer in the narrow sense of the word .	14.862661831884546
creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god .	6.302493101311958
there’s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , stephen said .	43.62578838614739
haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone .	28.009315827545297
he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it .	7.2152750450452725
thank you , stephen said , taking a cigarette .	5.28014917110514
haines helped himself and snapped the case to .	5.202992478428815
he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox , sprang it open too , and , having lit his cigarette , held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands .	24351.164885934784
yes , of course , he said , as they went on again .	29.173375179867186
either you believe or you don’t , isn’t it ?	6.592857065100468
personally i couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal god .	7.968653108535399
you don’t stand for that , i suppose ?	5.889985517229242
you behold in me , stephen said with grim displeasure , a horrible example of free thought .	33.022238529811
he walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side .	67.72886976247892
its ferrule followed lightly on the path , squealing at his heels .	11.862707127668886
my familiar , after me , calling , steeeeeeeeeeeephen !	7.986508442339297
a wavering line along the path .	2.7183695375068972
they will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark .	18.514082693265845
he wants that key .	1.6083031113276782
it is mine .	1.295546374989565
i paid the rent .	1.6319897496151765
now i eat his salt bread .	2.319411428429948
give him the key too .	2.3814279650983474
all .	1
he will ask for it .	2.240409142512719
that was in his eyes .	2.5295059917613196
after all , haines began.. .	1.9259134043649588
stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind .	51.052463436622915
after all , i should think you are able to free yourself .	15.155248808780303
you are your own master , it seems to me .	10.95401915132423
i am a servant of two masters , stephen said , an english and an italian .	35.802259200826036
italian ?	1
haines said .	1
a crazy queen , old and jealous .	3.9346932225971383
kneel down before me .	1.6709675193994284
and a third , stephen said , there is who wants me for odd jobs .	29.07188333331641
italian ?	1
haines said again .	1.3047805101527954
what do you mean ?	1.7781756209782609
the imperial british state , stephen answered , his colour rising , and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church .	100.07882811183678
haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke .	11.631425695952553
i can quite understand that , he said calmly .	3.4833937249760907
an irishman must think like that , i daresay .	5.535913602604458
we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly .	8.629895305634475
it seems history is to blame .	1.9845249094963686
the proud potent titles clanged over stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars .	2640.5079566907802
symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus , the voices blended , singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs .	2075.028263252165
a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one , and arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father , and valentine , spurning christ’s terrene body , and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son .	808055.1273445742
words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger .	17.112495200104977
idle mockery .	1
the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace , a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church , michael’s host , who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields .	27339.790969569374
hear , hear !	1.4442751729726904
prolonged applause .	1
zut !	1
nom de dieu !	1.213478238960303
of course i’m a britisher , haines’s voice said , and i feel as one .	30.660480769313782
i don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either .	27.246729150386543
that’s our national problem , i’m afraid , just now .	8.626679316348618
two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching businessman , boatman .	16.031366009050355
she’s making for bullock harbour .	1.9520429926598089
the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain .	14.222586199891872
there’s five fathoms out there , he said .	5.088207477295379
it’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one .	19.098898407795964
it’s nine days today .	1.5580492601453528
the man that was drowned .	2.948017777485956
a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite .	272.04944952119297
here i am .	1.4316706483540476
they followed the winding path down to the creek .	5.7375560152276135
buck mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder .	80.8381790168974
a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water .	287.11575737055523
is the brother with you , malachi ?	3.8157667755928895
down in westmeath .	1.1150300427930042
with the bannons .	1.1150300427930042
still there ?	1
i got a card from bannon .	3.18444014270541
says he found a sweet young thing down there .	6.790709998408778
photo girl he calls her .	2.0964256181665535
snapshot , eh ?	1.0671936222256428
brief exposure .	1
buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots .	3.95815642008389
an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face .	16.66863911481588
he scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth .	3479.2324229893347
buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at haines and stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone .	1201.8090216765925
seymour’s back in town , the young man said , grasping again his spur of rock .	39.17043209967529
chucked medicine and going in for the army .	5.195605456430289
ah , go to god !	2.6563216356023935
buck mulligan said .	1.2473661348490819
going over next week to stew .	2.33707184421608
you know that red carlisle girl , lily ?	4.089051462298646
yes .	1
spooning with him last night on the pier .	4.912630640501955
the father is rotto with money .	2.466250024591359
is she up the pole ?	2.0907539978484833
better ask seymour that .	1.4982499061690968
seymour a bleeding officer !	1.6215694452191165
buck mulligan said .	1.2473661348490819
he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely	47.7854952169194
redheaded women buck like goats .	1.8060631292384113
he broke off in alarm , feeling his side under his flapping shirt .	23.025510883787046
my twelfth rib is gone , he cried .	5.063097068383887
i’m the übermensch .	1.0514269685089446
toothless kinch and i , the supermen .	3.53317836575159
he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay .	46.51991336209705
are you going in here , malachi ?	4.296241316250641
yes .	1
make room in the bed .	1.9594356708820548
the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes .	125.6248882647963
haines sat down on a stone , smoking .	7.752595781035807
are you not coming in ?	2.1100177129416497
buck mulligan asked .	1.3425897113947753
later on , haines said .	2.3561577167787666
not on my breakfast .	1.692993154785786
stephen turned away .	1.3318591586449966
i’m going , mulligan , he said .	4.312358733974276
give us that key , kinch , buck mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat .	28.09726673219095
stephen handed him the key .	2.6078074950026404
buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes .	4.160879308804733
and twopence , he said , for a pint .	5.757462988483433
throw it there .	1.3478353191290873
stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap .	5.138151615954997
dressing , undressing .	1.1150300427930042
buck mulligan erect , with joined hands before him , said solemnly	10.321781067357422
he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord .	4.059578657150797
thus spake zarathustra .	1.1947002156310034
his plump body plunged .	1.4644925419800208
we’ll see you again , haines said , turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish .	99.62073533583563
horn of a bull , hoof of a horse , smile of a saxon .	31.09419319712247
the ship , buck mulligan cried .	2.33108348611662
half twelve .	1
good , stephen said .	1.6747148858615735
he walked along the upwardcurving path .	2.14499590645265
liliata rutilantium .	1
turma circumdet .	1
iubilantium te virginum .	1.4333219282906406
the priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly .	6.5674314518769075
i will not sleep here tonight .	3.033761828323088
home also i cannot go .	2.264982672804558
a voice , sweettoned and sustained , called to him from the sea .	20.938955528194597
turning the curve he waved his hand .	3.480067574717105
it called again .	1.1813712975194726
a sleek brown head , a seal’s , far out on the water , round .	32.916965152175344
usurper .	1
2	1
you , cochrane , what city sent for him ?	5.99063499261668
tarentum , sir .	1.2499939467782115
very good .	1
well ?	1
there was a battle , sir .	2.175023364239655
very good .	1
where ?	1
the boy’s blank face asked the blank window .	4.567853568697941
fabled by the daughters of memory .	2.4133776940982314
and yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it .	15.883720198764742
a phrase , then , of impatience , thud of blake’s wings of excess .	14.25931250063935
i hear the ruin of all space , shattered glass and toppling masonry , and time one livid final flame .	58.67744347674775
what’s left us then ?	1.5332750586695643
i forget the place , sir .	3.349592279938685
279 b. c.	1
asculum , stephen said , glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book .	29.104154365198323
yes , sir .	1.3430405722750218
and he said another victory like that and we are done for .	14.441861364554343
that phrase the world had remembered .	2.6055691534792107
a dull ease of the mind .	2.360178508898582
from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers , leaned upon his spear .	47.34843172090197
any general to any officers .	2.067433163776109
they lend ear .	1.1902224167996156
you , armstrong , stephen said .	3.4683994687446695
what was the end of pyrrhus ?	2.7307379772693112
end of pyrrhus , sir ?	2.4077341398666317
i know , sir .	1.4755959322076557
ask me , sir , comyn said .	2.3919993479409807
wait .	1
you , armstrong .	1.4441778743767237
do you know anything about pyrrhus ?	2.286046366861188
a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrong’s satchel .	3.3062034030058927
he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly .	10.639515473987057
crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips .	4.59531406391601
a sweetened boy’s breath .	1.4645520155298868
welloff people , proud that their eldest son was in the navy .	10.162171833298334
vico road , dalkey .	1.6978292771708088
pyrrhus , sir ?	1.2701315362082135
pyrrhus , a pier .	1.748159402359148
all laughed .	1
mirthless high malicious laughter .	1.3337251527156757
armstrong looked round at his classmates , silly glee in profile .	7.923403351592885
in a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay .	89.55343941029834
tell me now , stephen said , poking the boy’s shoulder with the book , what is a pier .	93.62166455238089
a pier , sir , armstrong said .	3.16034488907963
a thing out in the water .	3.645403633793243
a kind of a bridge .	2.076342365067758
kingstown pier , sir .	2.0311836099444087
some laughed again mirthless but with meaning .	3.38009502140944
two in the back bench whispered .	2.9281613154927864
yes .	1
they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent .	5.814611820514944
all .	1
with envy he watched their faces edith , ethel , gerty , lily .	13.673131787047822
their likes their breaths , too , sweetened with tea and jam , their bracelets tittering in the struggle .	44.71722365378595
kingstown pier , stephen said .	2.4185174101224924
yes , a disappointed bridge .	1.992438182498106
the words troubled their gaze .	1.740471157671338
how , sir ?	1.3751526806677428
comyn asked .	1
a bridge is across a river .	2.4313182620287717
for haines’s chapbook .	1.1751800344309515
no-one here to hear .	1.8957852857872997
tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk , to pierce the polished mail of his mind .	41.88604136721783
what then ?	1
a jester at the court of his master , indulged and disesteemed , winning a clement master’s praise .	43.970700383021146
why had they chosen all that part ?	3.6140365032617288
not wholly for the smooth caress .	2.759648901914196
for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard , their land a pawnshop .	67.54256264640796
had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death .	31.63928283377019
they are not to be thought away .	3.049300534889804
time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted .	73.68166128224942
but can those have been possible seeing that they never were ?	9.86582390344112
or was that only possible which came to pass ?	7.248541145508282
weave , weaver of the wind .	2.5833563963627273
tell us a story , sir .	3.8013250384000634
o , do , sir .	2.667005606457556
a ghoststory .	1
where do you begin in this ?	3.0119176619403207
stephen asked , opening another book .	2.7974294609983454
weep no more comyn said .	1.7167542063114423
go on then , talbot .	1.7269570962000114
and the story , sir ?	2.9498631424729442
after , stephen said .	1.6747148858615735
go on , talbot .	1.4906307798385707
a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel .	24.897075535917107
he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text	6.698862227456849
weep no more , woful shepherds , weep no more for lycidas , your sorrow , is not dead , sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.. .	438.97567559614833
it must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible .	15.981548535020037
aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read , sheltered from the sin of paris , night by night .	5358.622552443383
by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy .	6.5108923945229025
fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds .	2146.6379421922534
thought is the thought of thought .	3.3237788390515624
tranquil brightness .	1
the soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms .	63.97049337255193
tranquility sudden , vast , candescent form of forms .	5.274727698070571
talbot repeated	1
through the dear might of him that walked the waves ,	7.842163763137542
through the dear might.. .	1.5980007705067267
turn over , stephen said quietly .	2.102844983573082
i don’t see anything .	1.869879233538006
what , sir ?	1.2701315362082135
talbot asked simply , bending forward .	2.5652755659505795
his hand turned the page over .	2.9239768606551864
he leaned back and went on again , having just remembered .	16.868685477626023
of him that walked the waves .	2.5344368310595007
here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine .	43.42898118380891
it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute .	24.585439299483667
to caesar what is caesar’s , to god what is god’s .	10.000304995810462
a long look from dark eyes , a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms .	46.81193879018878
ay .	1
riddle me , riddle me , randy ro .	3.645270255540665
my father gave me seeds to sow .	3.258154673872497
talbot slid his closed book into his satchel .	3.861423249455611
have i heard all ?	1.7416396554557905
stephen asked .	1
yes , sir .	1.3430405722750218
hockey at ten , sir .	2.063764883114738
half day , sir .	1.9780359694926744
thursday .	1
who can answer a riddle ?	2.0319850434440143
stephen asked .	1
they bundled their books away , pencils clacking , pages rustling .	6.393551919367157
crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels , all gabbling gaily	6.4504666390279
a riddle , sir ?	1.881165208407142
ask me , sir .	1.679220773544436
o , ask me , sir .	2.619623163339637
a hard one , sir .	2.158323497687372
this is the riddle , stephen said	2.2077693590483842
the cock crew , the sky was blue the bells in heaven were striking eleven .	30.200617374313758
’tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven .	10.864545775448011
what is that ?	1.4403321825009003
what , sir ?	1.2701315362082135
again , sir .	1.1707060181813362
we didn’t hear .	1.2561767232923033
their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated .	5.77072816961473
after a silence cochrane said	1.6084833937093561
what is it , sir ?	2.3727580050407737
we give it up .	1.9828312285279517
stephen , his throat itching , answered	2.8884132725576106
the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush .	4.480078865657744
he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay .	36.754708319992005
a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called	14.196960798535818
hockey !	1
they broke asunder , sidling out of their benches , leaping them .	9.251341087023066
quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues .	102.34668833929548
sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook .	14.213301259930146
his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading .	65.18341559798505
on his cheek , dull and bloodless , a soft stain of ink lay , dateshaped , recent and damp as a snail’s bed .	161.56263289314606
he held out his copybook .	2.384087499603991
the word sums was written on the headline .	4.0221889267879725
beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot .	25.00141145998396
cyril sargent his name and seal .	3.276703690024543
mr deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir .	195.27815573753503
stephen touched the edges of the book .	4.35270649939595
futility .	1
do you understand how to do them now ?	6.110782614887441
he asked .	1
numbers eleven to fifteen , sargent answered .	2.698126014369755
mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board , sir .	21.761793539562703
can you do them yourself ?	2.192190257579002
stephen asked .	1
no , sir .	1.2766992222236904
ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink , a snail’s bed .	33.984903829106024
yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in her heart .	55.89864382107248
but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot , a squashed boneless snail .	51.36824695785159
she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own .	9.546197895964161
was that then real ?	1.7058039075402511
the only true thing in life ?	2.219446317895587
his mother’s prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode .	5.031061791412417
she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire , an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes .	139.60824190134815
she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been .	26.389088687317003
a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox , red reek of rapine in his fur , with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth , listened , scraped up the earth , listened , scraped and scraped .	40846.65793825192
sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem .	6.120247508939172
he proves by algebra that shakespeare’s ghost is hamlet’s grandfather .	4.6010180579078686
sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses .	3.292127398380001
hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field .	43.155714016036484
across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice , in the mummery of their letters , wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes .	130.35021746275504
give hands , traverse , bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors .	18.989476944389796
gone too from the world , averroes and moses maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend .	11338.414549806066
do you understand now ?	1.7279479394396637
can you work the second for yourself ?	4.231146195368673
yes , sir .	1.3430405722750218
in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data .	2.969914496296682
waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols , a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin .	323.4566228712183
amor matris subjective and objective genitive .	1.7102044387136701
with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands .	66.9621455118323
like him was i , these sloping shoulders , this gracelessness .	10.911353129199751
my childhood bends beside me .	1.8173972812589747
too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly .	17.995912015570898
mine is far and his secret as our eyes .	6.635708244325507
secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants , willing to be dethroned .	215.54949953032016
the sum was done .	1.6338006224857295
it is very simple , stephen said as he stood up .	7.721568024310915
yes , sir .	1.3430405722750218
thanks , sargent answered .	1.2239260849709572
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench .	50.551505306613116
you had better get your stick and go out to the others , stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form .	334.17118968672474
yes , sir .	1.3430405722750218
in the corridor his name was heard , called from the playfield .	19.325236841009016
sargent !	1
run on , stephen said .	2.361983658840905
mr deasy is calling you .	1.872416225319778
he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife .	78.57307196734463
they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet .	37.08939074870684
when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him .	9.455224697621604
he turned his angry white moustache .	2.8219764150860676
what is it now ?	1.578126899428264
he cried continually without listening .	1.7261748763280753
cochrane and halliday are on the same side , sir , stephen said .	16.172579892764
will you wait in my study for a moment , mr deasy said , till i restore order here .	106.12183470108404
and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly	22.59821066292711
what is the matter ?	1.733880525955029
what is it now ?	1.578126899428264
their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him , the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head .	295.13292453640787
stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs .	37.09158815964121
as on the first day he bargained with me here .	10.40052152623354
as it was in the beginning , is now .	7.9754924633332385
on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins , base treasure of a bog and ever shall be .	50.424786067333535
and snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end .	104.28123957364767
a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor .	11.42854916766743
blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table .	12.903370094537795
first , our little financial settlement , he said .	4.909714043528882
he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong .	11.25139556667277
it slapped open and he took from it two notes , one of joined halves , and laid them carefully on the table .	302.08939489455497
two , he said , strapping and stowing his pocketbook away .	6.098432370084124
and now his strongroom for the gold .	3.613973485065289
stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this , whorled as an emir’s turban , and this , the scallop of saint james .	3513.819233221432
an old pilgrim’s hoard , dead treasure , hollow shells .	4.769614515398507
a sovereign fell , bright and new , on the soft pile of the tablecloth .	27.36333479691335
three , mr deasy said , turning his little savingsbox about in his hand .	26.538686086618473
these are handy things to have .	2.8310151894482387
see .	1
this is for sovereigns .	1.582242212545121
this is for shillings .	1.7079645144971942
sixpences , halfcrowns .	1.1150300427930042

he shot from it two crowns and two shillings .	7.0051792307044725

i think you’ll find that’s right .	2.6377926793842614
thank you , sir , stephen said , gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers .	474.5699758869175
no thanks at all , mr deasy said .	5.333948573317157
you have earned it .	1.3624977659993278
stephen’s hand , free again , went back to the hollow shells .	14.978067174424444
symbols too of beauty and of power .	4.904860061708136
a lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery .	8.517471567754725
don’t carry it like that , mr deasy said .	6.088617454349785
you’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it .	5.14604552709389
you just buy one of these machines .	3.57329608254911
you’ll find them very handy .	2.018691520504191
answer something .	1
mine would be often empty , stephen said .	4.45163004466237
the same room and hour , the same wisdom and i the same .	23.82746802871035
three times now .	1.186353667662452
three nooses round me here .	1.976365544852685
well ?	1
i can break them in this instant if i will .	9.51526292427995
because you don’t save , mr deasy said , pointing his finger .	13.447548131145684
you don’t know yet what money is .	3.802789045877297
money is power .	1.2158546635834135
when you have lived as long as i have .	7.626544478124505
i know , i know .	2.249871985083953
if youth but knew .	1.3145223230403165
but what does shakespeare say ?	2.123787947866969
put but money in thy purse .	2.414744062492307
iago , stephen murmured .	1.7113522254737843
he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare .	15.10131614928222
he knew what money was , mr deasy said .	6.893028998240102
he made money .	1.178452230616809
a poet , yes , but an englishman too .	6.235593067942809
do you know what is the pride of the english ?	5.324484144878717
do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishman’s mouth ?	34.32883445163147
the seas’ ruler .	1.4384157230273509
his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words , unhating .	200.53081301920201
that on his empire , stephen said , the sun never sets .	12.908375607828631
ba !	1
mr deasy cried .	1.1849970649840613
that’s not english .	1.2042231383771527
a french celt said that .	1.8819610519907635
he tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail .	4.146368926929564
i will tell you , he said solemnly , what is his proudest boast .	13.528869925948959
i paid my way .	1.072392434569202
good man , good man .	2.6649263372511522
i paid my way .	1.072392434569202
i never borrowed a shilling in my life .	5.760074477226373
can you feel that ?	1.8999829898848835
i owe nothing .	1.1953240298168417
can you ?	1
mulligan , nine pounds , three pairs of socks , one pair brogues , ties .	28.669419464089145

the lump i have is useless .	2.5848096700920395
for the moment , no , stephen answered .	6.036976947246452
mr deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox .	11.194507915938406
i knew you couldn’t , he said joyously .	3.3762061269431527
but one day you must feel it .	4.220625178458794
we are a generous people but we must also be just .	11.064066812046574
i fear those big words , stephen said , which make us so unhappy .	21.28854061679523
mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs albert edward , prince of wales .	333.5742461605525
you think me an old fogey and an old tory , his thoughtful voice said .	26.32583369022561
i saw three generations since o’connell’s time .	2.482465000618961
i remember the famine in ’46 .	2.5829220194731284
do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before o’connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue ?	776.1046033850329
you fenians forget some things .	1.8597313742762285
glorious , pious and immortal memory .	2.6912124031065874
the lodge of diamond in armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes .	8.666760476274698
hoarse , masked and armed , the planters’ covenant .	4.18009877733503
the black north and true blue bible .	3.1056401526834705
croppies lie down .	1.1483300160487568
stephen sketched a brief gesture .	2.073238949370296
i have rebel blood in me too , mr deasy said .	11.586927402114632
on the spindle side .	1.4295536355828573
but i am descended from sir john blackwood who voted for the union .	13.917673436159848
we are all irish , all kings’ sons .	3.8185281801516733
alas , stephen said .	1.6747148858615735
per vias rectas mr deasy said firmly , was his motto .	6.509321889639887
he voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to dublin from the ards of down to do so .	170.58395737026487
lal the ral the ra the rocky road to dublin .	7.2145164127510135
a gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots .	3.0501019730514307
soft day , sir john !	2.6464210862627056
soft day , your honour!.. .	2.2248309259916357

lal the ral the ra .	2.0279875130864164
lal the ral the raddy .	1.6163437103824625
that reminds me , mr deasy said .	3.615814220296207
you can do me a favour , mr dedalus , with some of your literary friends .	38.84459629530667
i have a letter here for the press .	4.473674859123675
sit down a moment .	1.8553856098770125
i have just to copy the end .	4.431510137193611
he went to the desk near the window , pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter .	1067.1862205955865
sit down .	1
excuse me , he said over his shoulder , the dictates of common sense .	16.519523084944137
just a moment .	1.4149680164734688
he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and , muttering , began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly , sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error .	10508.56351956105
stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence .	3.9223479706257174
framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage , their meek heads poised in air lord hastings’ repulse the duke of westminster’s shotover the duke of beaufort’s ceylon prix de paris 1866 .	1143.9668459565203
elfin riders sat them , watchful of a sign .	6.4287958607130875
he saw their speeds , backing king’s colours , and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds .	29.06332377127399
full stop , mr deasy bade his keys .	4.343766322870337
but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question.. .	2.6096302973286947
where cranly led me to get rich quick , hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes , amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen , over the motley slush .	1765.0529134623578
even money fair rebel .	1.491096459582587
ten to one the field .	2.381925222863488
dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs , the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman , a butcher’s dame , nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange .	743.5225457794937
shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle .	9.145582556071705
again a goal .	1.0888085933743137
i am among them , among their battling bodies in a medley , the joust of life .	46.25354180417021
you mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick ?	8.684101908748634
jousts .	1
time shocked rebounds , shock by shock .	2.491700284477767
jousts , slush and uproar of battles , the frozen deathspew of the slain , a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts .	137.18801206727292
now then , mr deasy said , rising .	5.396401915258645
he came to the table , pinning together his sheets .	6.697857862917315
stephen stood up .	1.4441395436114606
i have put the matter into a nutshell , mr deasy said .	13.788854177274773
it’s about the foot and mouth disease .	3.2122324442591075
just look through it .	1.6698126230296717
there can be no two opinions on the matter .	6.359561005027948
may i trespass on your valuable space .	2.80278191606573
that doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history .	8.077964759225834
our cattle trade .	1.1773337166814883

i don’t mince words , do i ?	3.8973428100643863
mr deasy asked as stephen read on .	3.7109918127962214
foot and mouth disease .	1.8124254363407477

thanking you for the hospitality of your columns .	5.42529612933456
i want that to be printed and read , mr deasy said .	18.628123904894956
you will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on irish cattle .	27.03062707360362
and it can be cured .	2.221934383667489
it is cured .	1.1886369485030743
my cousin , blackwood price , writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in austria by cattledoctors there .	56.52126931088082
they offer to come over here .	3.099068586098651
i am trying to work up influence with the department .	6.548136723474551

i am surrounded by difficulties , by.. .	2.1342360631052033

backstairs influence by.. .	1.0578337956933173
he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke .	16.6463406955685
mark my words , mr dedalus , he said .	6.921460571391972
england is in the hands of the jews .	5.258429847816957
in all the highest places her finance , her press .	6.560634129793709
and they are the signs of a nation’s decay .	6.167982037847759
wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength .	5.43969231207263
i have seen it coming these years .	3.204780721325253
as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction .	63.46531378947592
old england is dying .	1.6219935746008807
he stepped swiftly off , his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam .	56.56383769430919
he faced about and back again .	2.900106168792335
dying , he said again , if not dead by now .	10.04171055595394
the harlot’s cry from street to street shall weave old england’s windingsheet .	8.364561471475312
his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted .	24.63417049208157
a merchant , stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ?	154.5103342126995
they sinned against the light , mr deasy said gravely .	6.5952667262790055
and you can see the darkness in their eyes .	9.04483094544898
and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day .	23.945809982988088
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers .	23.616680777794006
gabble of geese .	1.1185980566463813
they swarmed loud , uncouth about the temple , their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats .	28.676943868911337
not theirs these clothes , this speech , these gestures .	7.437233859896203
their full slow eyes belied the words , the gestures eager and unoffending , but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain .	405.46021826848346
vain patience to heap and hoard .	2.1763045926505065
time surely would scatter all .	1.800174667905189
a hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on .	6.5950314839013995
their eyes knew their years of wandering and , patient , knew the dishonours of their flesh .	39.8186571850792
who has not ?	1.3556096274249743
stephen said .	1
what do you mean ?	1.7781756209782609
mr deasy asked .	1.3701653793632604
he came forward a pace and stood by the table .	11.550118245395167
his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly .	2.235759179127352
is this old wisdom ?	1.5269059586537617
he waits to hear from me .	3.234603178768809
history , stephen said , is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake .	17.97120581103508
from the playfield the boys raised a shout .	5.669068339966959
a whirring whistle goal .	1.5721580227957348
what if that nightmare gave you a back kick ?	6.81677374315242
the ways of the creator are not our ways , mr deasy said .	20.918097630479092
all human history moves towards one great goal , the manifestation of god .	14.74148772518866
stephen jerked his thumb towards the window , saying	5.554017688880709
that is god .	1.2214828242208924
hooray !	1
ay !	1
whrrwhee !	1
what ?	1
mr deasy asked .	1.3701653793632604
a shout in the street , stephen answered , shrugging his shoulders .	14.399915847437786
mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers .	41.81096007385022
looking up again he set them free .	3.936131123543179
i am happier than you are , he said .	6.690492444916191
we have committed many errors and many sins .	3.8994348616106675
a woman brought sin into the world .	2.2628836405216
for a woman who was no better than she should be , helen , the runaway wife of menelaus , ten years the greeks made war on troy .	257.8570716296636
a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here , macmurrough’s wife and her leman , o’rourke , prince of breffni .	135.2169007546042
a woman too brought parnell low .	2.6653428238147088
many errors , many failures but not the one sin .	8.187368514405854
i am a struggler now at the end of my days .	8.463527865380598
but i will fight for the right till the end .	12.782587543525478
for ulster will fight and ulster will be right .	6.929705749812428
stephen raised the sheets in his hand .	4.450647153346638
well , sir , he began .	2.7581330435427778
i foresee , mr deasy said , that you will not remain here very long at this work .	59.35879204014037
you were not born to be a teacher , i think .	10.506282801149373
perhaps i am wrong .	1.7316043409871336
a learner rather , stephen said .	2.7555162306303953
and here what will you learn more ?	3.6719185231218097
mr deasy shook his head .	1.8480858056651608
who knows ?	1
he said .	1
to learn one must be humble .	2.814753596647886
but life is the great teacher .	3.2526777933769173
stephen rustled the sheets again .	2.5914341626760558
as regards these , he began .	3.356729336988568
yes , mr deasy said .	1.854684551637737
you have two copies there .	1.7784363854531238
if you can have them published at once .	4.6659082687106075
telegraph .	1
irish homestead .	1
i will try , stephen said , and let you know tomorrow .	11.685943087027587
i know two editors slightly .	1.682883399055757
that will do , mr deasy said briskly .	4.203120795368019
i wrote last night to mr field , m.p. there is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the city arms hotel .	233.20728881678383
i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting .	9.220635670555707
you see if you can get it into your two papers .	11.386069810614234
what are they ?	1.239534557419267
the evening telegraph.. .	1.1150300427930042
that will do , mr deasy said .	4.5104491298193885
there is no time to lose .	3.226060868132281
now i have to answer that letter from my cousin .	10.909303389664666
good morning , sir , stephen said , putting the sheets in his pocket .	30.659616672022317
thank you .	1
not at all , mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk .	25.53825724795289
i like to break a lance with you , old as i am .	17.729295293815987
good morning , sir , stephen said again , bowing to his bent back .	25.50961655551879
he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield .	1031.3503250509102
the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors .	24.680296389120542
still i will help him in his fight .	5.22254517099164
mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard .	7.240465646320737
mr dedalus !	1

looking for something lost in a past life .	5.672534619803574
suddenly he made off like a bounding hare , ears flung back , chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull .	72.11094099704322
the man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears .	3.0231944179125296

they waded a little way in the water and , stooping , soused their bags and , lifting them again , waded out .	250.1975958102423
the dog yelped running to them , reared up and pawed them , dropping on all fours , again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning .	453.5157122148592
unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand , a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws .	197.04655840225655
his speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop .	23.800638883988096
the carcass lay on his path .	2.643843876339925

he slunk back in a curve .	2.566561386920246
doesn’t see me .	1.311352557214687
along by the edge of the mole he lolloped , dawdled , smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it .	149.15505098213242

something he buried there , his grandmother .	4.356836614106931
he rooted in the sand , dabbling , delving and stopped to listen to the air , scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws , soon ceasing , a pard , a panther , got in spousebreach , vulturing the dead .	58882.67909312603

mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls .	12.990520452445923
he liked thick giblet soup , nutty gizzards , a stuffed roast heart , liverslices fried with crustcrumbs , fried hencods’ roes .	65.20608637450215
most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine .	69.83464308371543
kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly , righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray .	169.54793210378878
gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere .	31.457400632346516
made him feel a bit peckish .	2.654294838615799
the coals were reddening .	1.457669289997336
another slice of bread and butter three , four right .	9.780140057022718
she didn’t like her plate full .	3.118075134295318
right .	1
he turned from the tray , lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire .	90.19664361195167
it sat there , dull and squat , its spout stuck out .	12.701913415373435
cup of tea soon .	1.6969086782387395
good .	1
mouth dry .	1
the cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high .	14.82521165328053
mkgnao !	1
o , there you are , mr bloom said , turning from the fire .	23.614851639041458
the cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table , mewing .	39.63766799874047
just how she stalks over my writingtable .	2.9405939264466743
prr .	1
scratch my head .	1.3431622287895943
prr .	1
mr bloom watched curiously , kindly the lithe black form .	5.844414115680978
clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide , the white button under the butt of her tail , the green flashing eyes .	280.8952578477779
he bent down to her , his hands on his knees .	17.241939455464486
milk for the pussens , he said .	4.1314577882273404
mrkgnao !	1
the cat cried .	1.1849970649840613
they call them stupid .	1.6942764236547854
they understand what we say better than we understand them .	7.89646654664503
she understands all she wants to .	3.0010234908214932
vindictive too .	1

her nature .	1
curious mice never squeal .	1.3826393548496791

wonder what i look like to her .	5.061334978726077
height of a tower ?	1.726006072739037
no , she can jump me .	2.666369325512064
afraid of the chickens she is , he said mockingly .	5.029288372128551
afraid of the chookchooks .	1.4238018285925549
i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens .	8.774954000008515
mrkrgnao !	1
the cat said loudly .	1.4420914490400687
she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes , mewing plaintively and long , showing him her milkwhite teeth .	73.50578193485694
he watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones .	16.290811377312885
then he went to the dresser , took the jug hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him , poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor .	1485.849766465961
gurrhr !	1
she cried , running to lap .	3.1379609528733385
he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly .	43.927218853757545
wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after .	11.27467767799599
why ?	1
they shine in the dark , perhaps , the tips .	9.977984353094634
or kind of feelers in the dark , perhaps .	7.733192208953307
he listened to her licking lap .	2.775228865804042
ham and eggs , no .	2.2464615894040882
no good eggs with this drouth .	2.4790224440887356
want pure fresh water .	1.6442003587691179
thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckley’s .	13.262720432043567
fried with butter , a shake of pepper .	4.9374701069054945
better a pork kidney at dlugacz’s .	2.5495047094419676
while the kettle is boiling .	2.1333900151120724
she lapped slower , then licking the saucer clean .	4.795986191453554
why are their tongues so rough ?	2.4703630972574264
to lap better , all porous holes .	3.2875383192787946
nothing she can eat ?	1.6763285167675135
he glanced round him .	1.641297094668312
no .	1
on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall , paused by the bedroom door .	77.26949191525608
she might like something tasty .	2.1009687063847147
thin bread and butter she likes in the morning .	6.711675369934629
still perhaps once in a way .	2.8688995562216446
he said softly in the bare hall	3.0633805361882214
i’m going round the corner .	2.5608566841884213
be back in a minute .	1.9857846098589325
and when he had heard his voice say it he added	11.21263780650941
you don’t want anything for breakfast ?	3.2213006213847475
a sleepy soft grunt answered	1.465918162580317
mn .	1
no .	1
she didn’t want anything .	1.801654078405349
he heard then a warm heavy sigh , softer , as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled .	270.3073781353119
must get those settled really .	2.105817827657147
pity .	1
all the way from gibraltar .	2.2823094075917503

i rose from the ranks , sir , and i’m proud of it .	14.25419504622899
still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps .	12.84543928406888
now that was farseeing .	1.5755221370201322
his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof .	96.65116526312907
stamps stickyback pictures .	1.1939195699337466
daresay lots of officers are in the swim too .	5.4604957668487835

the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely plasto’s high grade ha .	29.82548545128235
he peeped quickly inside the leather headband .	2.8389861865876314
white slip of paper .	1.42085483475831
quite safe .	1
on the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey .	13.566656970900224

she said .	1
she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow .	32.257160696454896
he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs , sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder .	103.5607845590212
the warmth of her couched body rose on the air , mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured .	106.0388158438106
a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow .	7.773315084844915

he cried suddenly .	1.2144933579578063
he fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and , stubbing his toes against the broken commode , hurried out towards the smell , stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs .	3767.849173028752
pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan .	29.36468681802139
by prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back .	91.58381826489446
only a little burnt .	1.699609134722376
he tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it .	81.62781169026255

he sat down , cut and buttered a slice of the loaf .	14.616009247660717
he shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat .	17.531826408200146

done to a turn .	1.8368611396460455
a mouthful of tea .	1.6795585632946208
then he cut away dies of bread , sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth .	72.94061254518688
what was that about some young student and a picnic ?	9.083449496191038

mr dedalus , twisting his nose , frowned downward and said	8.421531724940829
unless i’m greatly mistaken .	1.431841952538106

a dying scrawl .	1.1751800344309515
he took it to heart , pined away .	5.242361445341968
quiet brute .	1
old men’s dogs usually are .	1.787825914551595
a raindrop spat on his hat .	3.01713322569076

there’s the sun again coming out .	2.9301980380870427
mr dedalus , peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun , hurled a mute curse at the sky .	72.50075916367382
it’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom , he said .	7.659806442520266
we’re off again .	1.2389954341675022
the carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently .	9.910103853511021

just that moment i was thinking .	3.4197526959408724
mr dedalus bent across to salute .	3.0256475483237426
from the door of the red bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply spruce figure passed .	85.98548275199195

and after thinking alone .	1.4549914701195559
body getting a bit softy .	1.8405181570422608
i would notice that from remembering .	2.7523874936399486
what causes that ?	1.2363509409446036
i suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off .	13.769682748510753

his eyes passed lightly over mr power’s goodlooking face .	4.701414861878519
greyish over the ears .	1.6429456893954935
madame smiling .	1
i smiled back .	1.206772715453174
a smile goes a long way .	3.375232665908573
only politeness perhaps .	1.1829818682279083
nice fellow .	1
who knows is that true about the woman he keeps ?	9.255311322970744
not pleasant for the wife .	2.449329140930599
yet they say , who was it told me , there is no carnal .	33.3360965207182
you would imagine that would get played out pretty quick .	7.1543655260070596

martin cunningham nudged mr power .	1.9306163565716805
of the tribe of reuben , he said .	3.504799293311683
a tall blackbearded figure , bent on a stick , stumping round the corner of elvery’s elephant house , showed them a curved hand open on his spine .	714.6081927356266
in all his pristine beauty , mr power said .	6.183461403388864
mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly	6.360174926174787
the devil break the hasp of your back !	4.277945905004416
mr power , collapsing in laughter , shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed gray’s statue .	80.51687391556152
we have all been there , martin cunningham said broadly .	4.698835771216683
his eyes met mr bloom’s eyes .	2.795920107762933
he caressed his beard , adding	2.3924186202483626
well , nearly all of us .	3.000653385004819
mr bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces .	11.626396020679168
that’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about reuben j and the son .	27.13667471560893
about the boatman ?	1.352441109168072
mr power asked .	1.2747027901177406
yes .	1
isn’t it awfully good ?	1.3116703749728786
what is that ?	1.4403321825009003
mr dedalus asked .	1.1898416795494093
i didn’t hear it .	1.7725471122369763
there was a girl in the case , mr bloom began , and he determined to send him to the isle of man out of harm’s way but when they were both.... .	2031.2820980446088

mr dedalus asked .	1.1898416795494093
that confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it ?	2.3358227456913987

mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils .	7.049588855165218
no , mr bloom said , the son himself.... .	4.3959455887526016
martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely	1.9266126376173591
reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the liffey .	16443.76055844197
for god’s sake !	1.2200942651624178
mr dedalus exclaimed in fright .	1.8973290921402137
is he dead ?	1.232895373474467
dead !	1
martin cunningham cried .	1.1849970649840613
not he !	1
a boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive .	1128.207806870735
half the town was there .	2.3741755539006757
yes , mr bloom said .	2.1003223023517648
but the funny part is.... .	1.6969668238866353
and reuben j , martin cunningham said , gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life .	48.43994617178895
a stifled sigh came from under mr power’s hand .	6.116870610668106
o , he did , martin cunningham affirmed .	3.528805848250131
like a hero .	1.3520251920699295

isn’t it awfully good ?	1.3116703749728786
mr bloom said eagerly .	1.0947808409246509
one and eightpence too much , mr dedalus said drily .	4.974783229674732
mr power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage .	5.602050719990784
nelson’s pillar .	1
eight plums a penny !	1.698598866025773
eight for a penny !	1.997228910475458
we had better look a little serious , martin cunningham said .	8.985521086506981
mr dedalus sighed .	1.441692940800594
ah then indeed , he said , poor little paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh .	30.316573943906953
many a good one he told himself .	3.736023737054465
the lord forgive me !	1.5152733257395465
mr power said , wiping his wet eyes with his fingers .	15.103308600794469
poor paddy !	1
i little thought a week ago when i saw him last and he was in his usual health that i’d be driving after him like this .	488.82468550994116

better luck next time .	1.473472864868789
poor little thing , mr dedalus said .	4.085225463837587
it’s well out of it .	2.2348195974131095
the carriage climbed more slowly the hill of rutland square .	6.789332868432561

in the midst of life , martin cunningham said .	4.510303599264553
but the worst of all , mr power said , is the man who takes his own life .	85.63736050824905
martin cunningham drew out his watch briskly , coughed and put it back .	17.74953495913294
the greatest disgrace to have in the family , mr power added .	13.40929030862581
temporary insanity , of course , martin cunningham said decisively .	5.201926814229464
we must take a charitable view of it .	4.90393008538343
they say a man who does it is a coward , mr dedalus said .	28.865109859181878
it is not for us to judge , martin cunningham said .	12.236697357093865

the carriage rattled swiftly along blessington street .	2.4735118221066497
over the stones .	1.1545685557450134
we are going the pace , i think , martin cunningham said .	17.105472540374414
god grant he doesn’t upset us on the road , mr power said .	21.119517959845254

they look terrible the women .	2.123892238417774
her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon .	7.832370635046141
then the screen round her bed for her to die .	9.653837459184318
nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me .	13.19106264428491
he’s gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me .	6.419687435829309
from one extreme to the other .	2.980808739889296
the carriage galloped round a corner stopped .	3.1994230834366295
what’s wrong now ?	1.2289205161081291
a divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows , lowing , slouching by on padded hoofs , whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups .	312.1853242725926
outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear .	7.240130422288222
emigrants , mr power said .	2.355312590541757

wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at clonsilla .	14.16146813659996
the carriage moved on through the drove .	2.7424133018523724
i can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays , mr bloom said .	144.36013110034284
all those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats .	9.226044631861653
instead of blocking up the thoroughfare , martin cunningham said .	5.887537950539912
quite right .	1
they ought to .	1.2846373431247375
yes , mr bloom said , and another thing i often thought , is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in milan , you know .	733.2574075220734
run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams , hearse and carriage and all .	67.90620226628315
don’t you see what i mean ?	3.4754865772882964
o , that be damned for a story , mr dedalus said .	20.133267849404593

a poor lookout for corny , mr power added .	4.044910709222856
why ?	1
mr bloom asked , turning to mr dedalus .	8.137319356422347
wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast ?	5.20843100407206
well , there’s something in that , mr dedalus granted .	8.458996169602953
and , martin cunningham said , we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road .	304.8284459189249
that was terrible , mr power’s shocked face said , and the corpse fell about the road .	41.203137689583265

mouth fallen open .	1.2055599572855276
asking what’s up now .	1.6243425027259648
quite right to close it .	2.3068691274033855
looks horrid open .	1.2055599572855276
then the insides decompose quickly .	1.7735188777954385
much better to close up all the orifices .	4.087780578934869
yes , also .	1.368803798805291
with wax .	1
the sphincter loose .	1.2249687474045092

but suppose now it did happen .	2.8018584482520246
would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about ?	11.407826532444528
he would and he wouldn’t , i suppose .	6.89905861864808
depends on where .	1.2348305736845093
the circulation stops .	1.1975249055536543
still some might ooze out of an artery .	3.652092617494127
it would be better to bury them in red a dark red .	18.669961168458652
in silence they drove along phibsborough road .	3.3794031500858064
an empty hearse trotted by , coming from the cemetery looks relieved .	14.082052872757469
crossguns bridge the royal canal .	2.526816260583288
water rushed roaring through the sluices .	2.3544296834214093
a man stood on his dropping barge , between clamps of turf .	9.199152703027702
on the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse .	4.342629210008569
aboard of the bugabu .	1.5767479202864618
their eyes watched him .	1.6117905834879254
on the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds , over slime , mudchoked bottles , carrion dogs .	601.426510674098
athlone , mullingar , moyvalley , i could make a walking tour to see milly by the canal .	48.825061650773605

i wonder how is our friend fogarty getting on , mr power said .	22.752592298873978

how is that ?	1.4290984302527616
martin cunningham said .	1.3807132910053428
left him weeping , i suppose ?	2.8906822516140953
though lost to sight , mr dedalus said , to memory dear .	11.17643580373483
the carriage steered left for finglas road .	2.638181377489627

on the curbstone before jimmy geary , the sexton’s , an old tramp sat , grumbling , emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot .	436.42991746172345
after life’s journey .	1.1947002156310034
gloomy gardens then went by one by one gloomy houses .	7.2380256934960645

that is where childs was murdered , he said .	5.641924183421396
the last house .	1.1979768078611344

or so they said .	1.874952483051035
the crown had no evidence , mr power said .	6.721056564680622
only circumstantial , martin cunningham added .	1.646038478114626
that’s the maxim of the law .	3.295945702684295
better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned .	17.174344578759733
they looked .	1
murderer’s ground .	1
it passed darkly .	1.1679612962860761

cramped in this carriage .	1.7158150658340516
she mightn’t like me to come that way without letting her know .	18.440554886779257
must be careful about women .	2.0487343963052234
catch them once with their pants down .	3.168528176700229
never forgive you after .	1.9895909561293288

the felly harshed against the curbstone stopped .	3.1088004377631746
martin cunningham put out his arm and , wrenching back the handle , shoved the door open with his knee .	112.7669733391477

mr power and mr dedalus followed .	3.3313320542068583

and a good armful she was .	2.8647287691975003
he looked behind through the others .	2.785204608839094

john henry menton’s large eyes stared ahead .	3.6899699426351726
the barrow turned into a side lane .	3.8651013439362574
a portly man , ambushed among the grasses , raised his hat in homage .	23.022236468531062
the gravediggers touched their caps .	2.163837044099089
john o’connell , mr power said pleased .	3.384437987975167

mr o’connell shook all their hands in silence .	5.273772648302697
mr dedalus said	1
i am come to pay you another visit .	5.196428395281727
my dear simon , the caretaker answered in a low voice .	10.944774122386933
i don’t want your custom at all .	3.6177652303784242
saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back .	136.14409745412812
did you hear that one , he asked them , about mulcahy from the coombe ?	41.654901783650274
i did not , martin cunningham said .	3.6367157168023505
they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear .	10.849713863489406
the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles .	149.69276971700342
they tell the story , he said , that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs .	822.42469178417
they asked for mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried .	21.36910520396829
after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough .	16.052350540440916
one of the drunks spelt out the name terence mulcahy .	5.794803163521649
the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up .	66.86386977994742
the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed .	8.82993409567572
he resumed	1
and , after blinking up at the sacred figure , not a bloody bit like the man says he .	102.00052410825242
that’s not mulcahy says he , whoever done it .	4.478263789216581
rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher , accepting the dockets given him , turning them over and scanning them as he walked .	681.5776656251066
that’s all done with a purpose , martin cunningham explained to hynes .	8.743442677727474
i know , hynes said .	2.008193569501069
i know that .	1.4366249324330416
to cheer a fellow up , martin cunningham said .	5.366793835520185
it’s pure goodheartedness damn the thing else .	2.2059434084923826

o , excuse me !	1.9844508894204782
he stepped aside nimbly .	1.621493454460906
clay , brown , damp , began to be seen in the hole .	18.220692426589277
it rose .	1
nearly over .	1
a mound of damp clods rose more , rose , and the gravediggers rested their spades .	32.69958846551341
all uncovered again for a few instants .	3.4458967781609995
the boy propped his wreath against a corner the brother-in-law his on a lump .	24.950040574221035
the gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow .	21.728945629639206
then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean .	5.334820653775132
one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass .	11.106916090695638
one , leaving his mates , walked slowly on with shouldered weapon , its blade blueglancing .	26.627850983867443
silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband .	3.75771143611241

the mourners moved away slowly without aim , by devious paths , staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb .	122.73762089213491
let us go round by the chief’s grave , hynes said .	11.057589801711138

some say he is not in that grave at all .	11.327243791060113
that the coffin was filled with stones .	3.3659443754526728

he’s there , all that was mortal of him .	8.099477381498092
peace to his ashes .	1.6417226224112635
mr bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels , crosses , broken pillars , family vaults , stone hopes praying with upcast eyes , old ireland’s hearts and hands .	705.2343584427857
more sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living .	13.33546927034016

he ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and , hungered , made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand .	341.5041504093111

alleluia .	1
just another spasm , ned lambert said .	3.6679782156811838
what is it ?	1.2691409564690643
mr bloom asked .	1.2532087128507625
a recently discovered fragment of cicero , professor machugh answered with pomp of tone .	10.629408281027665
our lovely land .	1.0963238625872496
short but to the point	1.9290452399697284
whose land ?	1
mr bloom said simply .	1.212066018220657
most pertinent question , the professor said between his chews .	5.7906526297530565
with an accent on the whose .	2.5078071045931885
dan dawson’s land mr dedalus said .	2.7015789431659907
is it his speech last night ?	3.2047563478609242
mr bloom asked .	1.2532087128507625
ned lambert nodded .	1.1759874926903178
but listen to this , he said .	5.200819315962214
the doorknob hit mr bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in .	85.55792735608799
excuse me , j. j. o’molloy said , entering .	4.851879057055053
mr bloom moved nimbly aside .	2.0750364343283176

you’re looking extra .	1.2043377977301029
is the editor to be seen ?	3.1025177967173243
j. j. o’molloy asked , looking towards the inner door .	8.74586453087726
very much so , professor machugh said .	4.482360232462105
to be seen and heard .	2.1878805834960864
he’s in his sanctum with lenehan .	2.38841576972545

the professor broke in testily .	1.97406894200898

peaks ned lambert went on , towering high on high , to bathe our souls , as it were.. .	95.8522652115152

that’ll do , ned .	1.8610588378818211
life is too short .	1.694720386488888
he took off his silk hat and , blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache , welshcombed his hair with raking fingers .	116.53519695037788
ned lambert tossed the newspaper aside , chuckling with delight .	6.687166818083961
an instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor machugh’s unshaven blackspectacled face .	21.288664705782796
doughy daw !	1
he cried .	1
what wetherup said	1
all very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff .	89.03336276679276
he was in the bakery line too , wasn’t he ?	6.059774259570605
why they call him doughy daw .	2.718567626073177
feathered his nest well anyhow .	1.7249712938690909

the inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face , crested by a comb of feathery hair , thrust itself in .	183.30507431965813
the bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked	11.318223952709793
what is it ?	1.2691409564690643
and here comes the sham squire himself !	3.225201145013457
professor machugh said grandly .	1.4156061278799672

the editor said in recognition .	1.993357023452726

i must get a drink after that .	4.677819475898655

the editor cried .	1.4406395307046562
no drinks served before mass .	1.836494234193748
quite right too , mr dedalus said , going out .	9.153733846074513
come on , ned .	1.5928578053566895
ned lambert sidled down from the table .	2.9476917987598097
the editor’s blue eyes roved towards mr bloom’s face , shadowed by a smile .	22.64575642393393
will you join us , myles ?	2.9148657362407997
ned lambert asked .	1.2747027901177406
memorable battles recalled	1
north cork militia !	1.1233139458511303
the editor cried , striding to the mantelpiece .	5.542964668946926

north cork and spanish officers !	2.01961693836789

ned lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps .	8.350340228601274
in ohio !	1
the editor shouted .	1.2177832239474098
so it was , begad , ned lambert agreed .	4.419792881489661
passing out he whispered to j. j. o’molloy	2.8518830559834254
incipient jigs .	1
sad case .	1
ohio !	1
the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face .	8.232847974347342
my ohio !	1
a perfect cretic !	1.1233139458511303
the professor said .	1.4425778833075398
long , short and long .	2.269837752818851
o , harp eolian !	1.3745152965644056
he took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and , breaking off a piece , twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth .	1451.1666761200447
bingbang , bangbang .	1.1150300427930042
mr bloom , seeing the coast clear , made for the inner door .	20.75543390841015
just a moment , mr crawford , he said .	10.050979354659273
i just want to phone about an ad .	4.6941655821834685
he went in .	1.4398411915843907
what about that leader this evening ?	2.6905823954995367
professor machugh asked , coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder .	60.090825277810005
that’ll be all right , myles crawford said more calmly .	5.110562796657037
never you fret .	1.1150300427930042
hello , jack .	1.4100442784821183
that’s all right .	1.2824078615369292
good day , myles , j. j. o’molloy said , letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file .	129.3022984805875
is that canada swindle case on today ?	2.8258144484817325
the telephone whirred inside .	1.7136063146243798

lenehan came out of the inner office with sport ’s tissues .	7.61768441924357
who wants a dead cert for the gold cup ?	8.765522548003087
he asked .	1
sceptre with o. madden up .	1.497709328086765
he tossed the tissues on to the table .	6.190112107561409
screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open .	27.653012173352256
hush , lenehan said .	1.6500847996696455
i hear feetstoops .	1.1150300427930042
professor machugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps .	348.71370708648664
the tissues rustled up in the draught , floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth .	83.540674795391
it wasn’t me , sir .	2.324486881335468
it was the big fellow shoved me , sir .	5.655684275283177
throw him out and shut the door , the editor said .	17.08237585666815
there’s a hurricane blowing .	1.3757454058015581
lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor , grunting as he stooped twice .	36.31236411925836
waiting for the racing special , sir , the newsboy said .	7.6139320628428635
it was pat farrell shoved me , sir .	3.710332137814951
he pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe .	5.6065094646961064
him , sir .	1.2499939467782115
out of this with you , professor machugh said gruffly .	6.121290254320888
he hustled the boy out and banged the door to .	9.14026482355441
j. j. o’molloy turned the files crackingly over , murmuring , seeking	11.469707602331395
continued on page six , column four .	3.025061463323374
yes , evening telegraph here , mr bloom phoned from the inner office .	16.81381967857083
is the boss... ?	1.1230690951215554
yes , telegraph .. .	1.3731563121846082
to where ?	1
aha !	1

aha !	1
i see.. .	1
right .	1
i’ll catch him .	1.2573689200512808
a collision ensues	1
the bell whirred again as he rang off .	4.006614429285903
he came in quickly and bumped against lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue .	38.950535331779506
pardon , monsieur lenehan said , clutching him for an instant and making a grimace .	35.40330739745882
my fault , mr bloom said , suffering his grip .	6.754984347103106
are you hurt ?	1.1353646794696453
i’m in a hurry .	2.0402654192980094
knee , lenehan said .	1.6500847996696455
he made a comic face and whined , rubbing his knee	5.509533628957624
the accumulation of the anno domini .	2.197433305512207
sorry , mr bloom said .	2.177419343319599
he went to the door and , holding it ajar , paused .	17.443484854111382
j. j. o’molloy slapped the heavy pages over .	3.9628178658032347
the noise of two shrill voices , a mouthorgan , echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps	120.45945318890453
we are the boys of wexford who fought with heart and hand .	19.65039737961331
exit bloom	1
i’m just running round to bachelor’s walk , mr bloom said , about this ad of keyes’s .	40.33615645645111
want to fix it up .	2.1390634574620377
they tell me he’s round there in dillon’s .	5.048577335658248
he looked indecisively for a moment at their faces .	6.745913046865436
the editor who , leaning against the mantelshelf , had propped his head on his hand , suddenly stretched forth an arm amply .	200.78866682318596
begone !	1
he said .	1
the world is before you .	2.3675691587128163
back in no time , mr bloom said , hurrying out .	10.657293293735634
j. j. o’molloy took the tissues from lenehan’s hand and read them , blowing them apart gently , without comment .	134.15031529474783
he’ll get that advertisement , the professor said , staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind .	46.55047663635343
look at the young scamps after him .	3.4508621209078334
show .	1
where ?	1
lenehan cried , running to the window .	4.900469680819837
a street cortège	1
both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in mr bloom’s wake , the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite , a tail of white bowknots .	1574.0073754760078
look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry , lenehan said , and you’ll kick .	52.95136197491742
o , my rib risible !	1.647541854778274
taking off his flat spaugs and the walk .	4.146853280763985
small nines .	1
steal upon larks .	1.1150300427930042
he began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to j. j. o’molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands .	245.1500997509565
what’s that ?	1
myles crawford said with a start .	2.3240947155873033
where are the other two gone ?	3.5807292374765285
who ?	1
the professor said , turning .	2.3864757524255262
they’re gone round to the oval for a drink .	5.465034434155295
paddy hooper is there with jack hall .	3.5908245088983395
came over last night .	1.6350872563410626
come on then , myles crawford said .	3.132074059455893
where’s my hat ?	1.4387944924242666
he walked jerkily into the office behind , parting the vent of his jacket , jingling his keys in his back pocket .	125.25262742152186
they jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer .	39.789297104898004
he’s pretty well on , professor machugh said in a low voice .	12.785126483056445
seems to be , j. j. o’molloy said , taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation , but it is not always as it seems .	409.7272079822388
who has the most matches ?	2.3580247547526247
the calumet of peace	1.2407712137767954
he offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself .	11.580277584174754
lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn .	19.227303567724316
j. j. o’molloy opened his case again and offered it .	5.97157966273665
thanky vous lenehan said , helping himself .	3.024206773333946
the editor came from the inner office , a straw hat awry on his brow .	35.340017528048854
he declaimed in song , pointing sternly at professor machugh	4.777262641263948
’twas rank and fame that tempted thee , ’twas empire charmed thy heart .	10.95417058503239
the professor grinned , locking his long lips .	3.935525822498739
eh ?	1
you bloody old roman empire ?	2.1615613390668287
myles crawford said .	1.4349233134400856
he took a cigarette from the open case .	4.421240843005773
lenehan , lighting it for him with quick grace , said	9.478480043861005
silence for my brandnew riddle !	2.226176676425488
imperium romanum j. j. o’molloy said gently .	2.5949689225870767
it sounds nobler than british or brixton .	2.49939212574442
the word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire .	6.932536115417472
myles crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling .	5.34313399465788
that’s it , he said .	2.228786861943281
we are the fat .	1.8663864886834962
you and i are the fat in the fire .	6.978266857057871
we haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell .	6.253104907870305
the grandeur that was rome	1.7385459223186777
wait a moment , professor machugh said , raising two quiet claws .	13.404648581202595
we mustn’t be led away by words , by sounds of words .	13.291427213869017
we think of rome , imperial , imperious , imperative .	5.525006558539769
he extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs , pausing	3.4709236406752515
what was their civilisation ?	1.7931101034614547
vast , i allow but vile .	2.5801801337036094
cloacae sewers .	1
the jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said it is meet to be here .	21.68306424791492
let us build an altar to jehovah .	2.959389070408506
the roman , like the englishman who follows in his footsteps , brought to every new shore on which he set his foot ( on our shore he never set it ) only his cloacal obsession .	6357.2794628654065
he gazed about him in his toga and he said it is meet to be here .	24.771409127756517

j. j. o’molloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly	10.934668825895962
one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe .	121.63640897113441
it was in that case of fratricide , the childs murder case .	15.527140107588187

he spoke on the law of evidence , j. j. o’molloy said , of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code , the lex talionis .	279.9122914978381

i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act , trivial in itself , that striking of that match , that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives .	8413.552980959086
a polished period	1
j. j. o’molloy resumed , moulding his words	2.102576454536689
he said of it that stony effigy in frozen music , horned and terrible , of the human form divine , that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which , if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live , deserves to live .	526560.436537178

stephen , his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture , blushed .	16.567325031476095
he took a cigarette from the case .	3.633018931101067
j. j. o’molloy offered his case to myles crawford .	4.052326991925918

professor magennis was speaking to me about you , j. j. o’molloy said to stephen .	27.140137340801655

she was a nice old bag of tricks .	4.855171502011954
a. e. has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness .	410.79626626453575
magennis thinks you must have been pulling a. e.’s leg .	6.6694552971956576
he is a man of the very highest morale , magennis .	8.28708698834183
speaking about me .	1.3365626040553322
what did he say ?	1.9894501276071477
what did he say ?	1.9894501276071477
what did he say about me ?	3.479949702750223
don’t ask .	1
no , thanks , professor machugh said , waving the cigarettecase aside .	14.287289811243253
wait a moment .	1.3703749052735927
let me say one thing .	2.1218234509025207
the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society .	107.3504076422826
mr justice fitzgibbon , the present lord justice of appeal , had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay ( new for those days ), advocating the revival of the irish tongue .	2548.0407283596696
he turned towards myles crawford and said	2.6415751356389414
you know gerald fitzgibbon .	1.4667324306686107
then you can imagine the style of his discourse .	6.831938187258309
he is sitting with tim healy , j. j. o’molloy said , rumour has it , on the trinity college estates commission .	79.31534418461729
he is sitting with a sweet thing , myles crawford said , in a child’s frock .	42.5976679798173
go on .	1
well ?	1
it was the speech , mark you , the professor said , of a finished orator , full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement .	25529.446149281022
it was then a new movement .	3.206551846995576
we were weak , therefore worthless .	2.2447382126992492
he closed his long thin lips an instant but , eager to be on , raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and , with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims , steadied them to a new focus .	18898.509492689416
impromptu	1
in ferial tone he addressed j. j. o’molloy	3.058044972585883
taylor had come there , you must know , from a sickbed .	18.108483653006214
that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall .	94.6206159047878
his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it .	9.982597107344729
he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked ( though he was not ) a dying man .	122.15279250575297
his gaze turned at once but slowly from j. j. o’molloy’s towards stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground , seeking .	400.72040271780844
his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head , soiled by his withering hair .	24.120972113860468
still seeking , he said	1.5748205546628893
when fitzgibbon’s speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply .	7.236755071535033
briefly , as well as i can bring them to mind , his words were these .	66.0531668105283
he raised his head firmly .	2.1393710023162167
his eyes bethought themselves once more .	2.3595985125346153
witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro , seeking outlet .	12.008287059528941
he began	1
mr chairman , ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend .	449.31398552764426
it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country , into an age remote from this age , that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses .	1064834.375637578
his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear , their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech .	77.11737147970592
and let our crooked smokes .	1.7624243210486634
noble words coming .	1.2161516969349921
look out .	1
could you try your hand at it yourself ?	5.960344254690497
and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride .	275.1012747659115
i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me .	9.830400305677767
from the fathers	1
it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted .	652.1632058260753
ah , curse you !	1.6536750183299278
that’s saint augustine .	1.1947002156310034
why will you jews not accept our culture , our religion and our language ?	20.11268262507118
you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people .	9.042017915036197
you have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys , trireme and quadrireme , laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe .	672.2282504505079
you have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature , a priesthood , an agelong history and a polity .	68.47171965791459
nile .	1
child , man , effigy .	1.8885419692522607
by the nilebank the babemaries kneel , cradle of bulrushes a man supple in combat stonehorned , stonebearded , heart of stone .	63.33489491309954
you pray to a local and obscure idol our temples , majestic and mysterious , are the abodes of isis and osiris , of horus and ammon ra .	213.84453538484897
yours serfdom , awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas .	8.401372650154164
israel is weak and few are her children egypt is an host and terrible are her arms .	40.77942911166147
vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name .	10.98187555706482
a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech .	3.643796999310083
he lifted his voice above it boldly	2.692767372648359
but , ladies and gentlemen , had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life , had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage , nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day .	4555007.521807351
he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law , graven in the language of the outlaw .	90311.81302000448
he ceased and looked at them , enjoying a silence .	11.481321390059785
ominous for him !	1.3930731434126484
j. j. o’molloy said not without regret	2.612884356941769
and yet he died without having entered the land of promise .	9.897486688883232
a sudden at the moment though from lingering illness often previously expectorated demise , lenehan added .	20.186389099986474
and with a great future behind him .	3.4463642456282613
the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase .	33.45997858577113
that is oratory , the professor said uncontradicted .	3.1041605252001854

as the next motion on the agenda paper may i suggest that the house do now adjourn ?	38.727807006453524
you take my breath away .	2.04772733505917
it is not perchance a french compliment ?	3.2158032909010554
mr o’madden burke asked .	1.3603044514628593
’tis the hour , methinks , when the winejug , metaphorically speaking , is most grateful in ye ancient hostelry .	50.063622902273316
that it be and hereby is resolutely resolved .	3.917573806798502
all that are in favour say ay , lenehan announced .	8.92151839793909
the contrary no .	1.2196879774852014
i declare it carried .	1.5094604538053094
to which particular boosing shed... ?	1.5528487527468366
my casting vote is mooney’s !	1.7063679962013965
he led the way , admonishing	2.1188148999536693
we will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters , will we not ?	16.473911242361567
yes , we will not .	2.8744443675052147
by no manner of means .	1.9160010050016565
mr o’madden burke , following close , said with an ally’s lunge of his umbrella	27.30721702349548
lay on , macduff !	1.5851889505072903
chip of the old block !	2.591576263622259
the editor cried , clapping stephen on the shoulder .	8.710454450542114
let us go .	1.4443743552137296
where are those blasted keys ?	2.000146347450858
he fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets .	6.163455930624885

i know .	1
that’ll be all right .	1.5689070699404628

where are they ?	1.239534557419267
that’s all right .	1.2824078615369292
he thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office .	14.610369801559015
let us hope	1
j. j. o’molloy , about to follow him in , said quietly to stephen	26.313705092609005
i hope you will live to see it published .	7.839301776888061
myles , one moment .	1.73165936279075

they give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase , grunting , encouraging each other , afraid of the dark , panting , one asking the other have you the brawn , praising god and the blessed virgin , threatening to come down , peeping at the airslits .	2643715.669354046
glory be to god .	1.699984284812815

a bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps , scattering in all directions , yelling , their white papers fluttering .	124.4994576726852
hard after them myles crawford appeared on the steps , his hat aureoling his scarlet face , talking with j. j. o’molloy .	153.45067617203108

it is the ghost , the king , a king and no king , and the player is shakespeare who has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre .	52265.941829564756
he speaks the words to burbage , the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth , calling him by a name	321.5719283639684

mr dedalus , your views are most illuminating .	3.7689127820545103
he creaked to and fro , tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine , and , covered by the noise of outgoing , said low	313.77805919737773

i was prepared for paradoxes from what malachi mulligan told us but i may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that shakespeare is hamlet you have a stern task before you .	7193.349400568303

as we , or mother dana , weave and unweave our bodies , stephen said , from day to day , their molecules shuttled to and fro , so does the artist weave and unweave his image .	5161.476029597854
and as the mole on my right breast is where it was when i was born , though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time , so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth .	179061.26572468164
in the intense instant of imagination , when the mind , shelley says , is a fading coal , that which i was is that which i am and that which in possibility i may come to be .	20750.920014894004
so in the future , the sister of the past , i may see myself as i sit here now but by reflection from that which then i shall be .	3107.1382971161133
drummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile .	3.5620782928760586
yes , mr best said youngly .	2.505247864859721
i feel hamlet quite young .	1.8786524776157958
the bitterness might be from the father but the passages with ophelia are surely from the son .	50.20497979037287

he is in my father .	2.6890704382644555

that mole is the last to go , stephen said , laughing .	14.50900805738804
john eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow .	2.7936565259582946
if that were the birthmark of genius , he said , genius would be a drug in the market .	64.76606011226596
the plays of shakespeare’s later years which renan admired so much breathe another spirit .	13.140596889901898
the spirit of reconciliation , the quaker librarian breathed .	4.242159119541736
there can be no reconciliation , stephen said , if there has not been a sundering .	28.102562346547074
said that .	1

his own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience , material and moral .	127.84618495999291
such an appeal will touch him .	2.7265497621459533
the images of other males of his blood will repel him .	8.831850844729988
he will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself .	23.498567822373104
the benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope .	5.85277171895544
i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public .	32.15195026047077
and we ought to mention another irish commentator , mr george bernard shaw .	10.726332768952952
nor should we forget mr frank harris .	2.7387191988566157
his articles on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant .	7.119338120203852
oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets .	51.24510500241501
the favoured rival is william herbert , earl of pembroke .	4.304767118257645
i own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with what shall i say ?	157.7255457163899
our notions of what ought not to have been .	7.388101064125846
felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them , auk’s egg , prize of their fray .	53.747508151217296
he thous and thees her with grave husbandwords .	3.6910761500360154
dost love , miriam ?	1.7101196684553743
dost love thy man ?	1.530877230402584
that may be too , stephen said .	4.270719094463729
there’s a saying of goethe’s which mr magee likes to quote .	8.075098103730877
beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life .	36.49328469948424
why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride , a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood , a lordling to woo for him ?	2291.849233927729
he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet .	137.44534095084592
why ?	1
belief in himself has been untimely killed .	3.246754115927904
he was overborne in a cornfield first ( ryefield , i should say ) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down .	6117.938375257989
assumed dongiovannism will not save him .	2.7942857503043563
no later undoing will undo the first undoing .	3.5800879286646845
the tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding .	10.81375225259853
if the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon .	12.222254890629983
there is , i feel in the words , some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion , a darker shadow of the first , darkening even his own understanding of himself .	6119.3667594011495
a like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool .	9.987857200401015
they list .	1
and in the porches of their ears i pour .	5.703892669699787
the soul has been before stricken mortally , a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear .	70.00334968951584
but those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come .	1703.8430033523678
the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator .	533.7402728714967
that is why the speech ( his lean unlovely english ) is always turned elsewhere , backward .	37.329056564958655
ravisher and ravished , what he would but would not , go with him from lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to imogen’s breast , bare , with its mole cinquespotted .	1017.7978695288618
he goes back , weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself , an old dog licking an old sore .	530.0506954521873
but , because loss is his gain , he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality , untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed .	1556.9334677475292
his beaver is up .	1.6719630795849898
he is a ghost , a shadow now , the wind by elsinore’s rocks or what you will , the sea’s voice , a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow , the son consubstantial with the father .	230720.54290504428
amen !	1

a ribald face , sullen as a dean’s , buck mulligan came forward , then blithe in motley , towards the greeting of their smiles .	198.9703241906278

you were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate , if i mistake not ?	9.001781737541567
he asked of stephen .	1.8820290646007005
primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed panama as with a bauble .	11.178676757409034

he who himself begot middler the holy ghost and himself sent himself , agenbuyer , between himself and others , who , put upon by his fiends , stripped and whipped , was nailed like bat to barndoor , starved on crosstree , who let him bury , stood up , harrowed hell , fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of his own self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already .	9725626679.333712

o , flowers !	1.3362812801493085
bells with bells with bells aquiring .	2.704810497895734
yes , indeed , the quaker librarian said .	5.57428704635822
a most instructive discussion .	1.5447039158618967
mr mulligan , i’ll be bound , has his theory too of the play and of shakespeare .	72.19181495174351
all sides of life should be represented .	3.546807587817868
he smiled on all sides equally .	2.7089995828858227
buck mulligan thought , puzzled	1.710190447035951
shakespeare ?	1
he said .	1
i seem to know the name .	4.029426098703311
a flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features .	4.77003665429192
to be sure , he said , remembering brightly .	5.608650543798239
the chap that writes like synge .	2.630686945458356
mr best turned to him .	2.8939122607980323
haines missed you , he said .	2.5985925840692174
did you meet him ?	1.689545996669036
he’ll see you after at the d. b. c. he’s gone to gill’s to buy hyde’s lovesongs of connacht .	41.881604373262064
i came through the museum , buck mulligan said .	4.442957490229421
was he here ?	1.2367609554717163
the bard’s fellowcountrymen , john eglinton answered , are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising .	24.902307436512846
i hear that an actress played hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin .	24.8511029602608
vining held that the prince was a woman .	4.663405322784557
has no-one made him out to be an irishman ?	8.78883129394996
judge barton , i believe , is searching for some clues .	10.384649417393621
he swears ( his highness not his lordship ) by saint patrick .	12.766876523949172
the most brilliant of all is that story of wilde’s , mr best said , lifting his brilliant notebook .	155.9219901388756
that portrait of mr w. h. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes , a man all hues .	225.0626921666646
for willie hughes , is it not ?	3.5475742137815853
the quaker librarian asked .	1.4226768447136668
or hughie wills ?	1.2023280436275727
mr william himself .	1.2006829698023118
w. h. who am i ?	2.1173626634215186
i mean , for willie hughes , mr best said , amending his gloss easily .	21.700161748043136
of course it’s all paradox , don’t you know , hughes and hews and hues , the colour , but it’s so typical the way he works it out .	846.9920844334999
it’s the very essence of wilde , don’t you know .	8.244681883405091
the light touch .	1.2026929619732936
his glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled , a blond ephebe .	19.565900570500776
tame essence of wilde .	1.8542791965643004
you’re darned witty .	1.1919481431085317

they talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness .	1.8943636004498914
buck mulligan’s again heavy face eyed stephen awhile .	3.6675901773009856

the tramper synge is looking for you , he said , to murder you .	13.783196804596368

suddenly he turned to stephen	1.9137264544544035
he knows you .	1.3288640375061467
he knows your old fellow .	1.5516281402580516

we want to hear more , john eglinton decided with mr best’s approval .	15.595378655131883
we begin to be interested in mrs s. till now we had thought of her , if at all , as a patient griselda , a penelope stayathome .	887.6335704363577
antisthenes , pupil of gorgias , stephen said , took the palm of beauty from kyrios menelaus’ brooddam , argive helen , the wooden mare of troy in whom a score of heroes slept , and handed it to poor penelope .	3513.2120683164067
twenty years he lived in london and , during part of that time , he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of ireland .	1508.6072128358403
his life was rich .	1.6381844352535395
his art , more than the art of feudalism as walt whitman called it , is the art of surfeit .	50.79444951367202
hot herringpies , green mugs of sack , honeysauces , sugar of roses , marchpane , gooseberried pigeons , ringocandies .	44.09021395906988
sir walter raleigh , when they arrested him , had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays .	184.23919409034917
the gombeenwoman eliza tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of sheba .	10.756320327793834
twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures .	51.78876782267007
you know manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade dick burbage to her bed after she had seen him in richard iii and how shakespeare , overhearing , without more ado about nothing , took the cow by the horns and , when burbage came knocking at the gate , answered from the capon’s blankets william the conqueror came before richard iii .	4181903.4237924507

and sir william davenant of oxford’s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary .	19.590788019068977
buck mulligan , his pious eyes upturned , prayed	4.791019061470978
blessed margaret mary anycock !	1.3898656594940606
and harry of six wives’ daughter .	2.2382738745949897
and other lady friends from neighbour seats as lawn tennyson , gentleman poet , sings .	16.233051960991194
but all those twenty years what do you suppose poor penelope in stratford was doing behind the diamond panes ?	63.257293316501226
do and do .	1.3823969466446668
thing done .	1
in a rosery of fetter lane of gerard , herbalist , he walks , greyedauburn .	11.434169807829578
an azured harebell like her veins .	2.2397593425170848
lids of juno’s eyes , violets .	2.296161813196021
he walks .	1
one life is all .	1.606723152300624
one body .	1
do .	1
but do .	1
afar , in a reek of lust and squalor , hands are laid on whiteness .	18.214558978050825
buck mulligan rapped john eglinton’s desk sharply .	3.2389526369349837
whom do you suspect ?	1.528867505845972
he challenged .	1
say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets .	8.8433724102828
once spurned twice spurned .	1.502224227368248
but the court wanton spurned him for a lord , his dearmylove .	12.273338680977723
love that dare not speak its name .	2.038737390255119
as an englishman , you mean , john sturdy eglinton put in , he loved a lord .	90.4018617202105
old wall where sudden lizards flash .	2.0850504572585313
at charenton i watched them .	2.0421013032362154
it seems so , stephen said , when he wants to do for him , and for all other and singular uneared wombs , the holy office an ostler does for the stallion .	2795.334082209449
maybe , like socrates , he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife .	47.41298685124652
but she , the giglot wanton , did not break a bedvow .	10.987973854115396
two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined , deceased husband’s brother .	133.87189451530693
sweet ann , i take it , was hot in the blood .	18.122634496892765
once a wooer , twice a wooer .	3.1488549068253997
stephen turned boldly in his chair .	3.0074291161918714
the burden of proof is with you not with me , he said frowning .	26.677109018256935
if you deny that in the fifth scene of hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him .	27479.95983493022
all those women saw their men down and under mary , her goodman john , ann , her poor dear willun , when he went and died on her , raging that he was the first to go , joan , her four brothers , judith , her husband and all her sons , susan , her husband too , while susan’s daughter , elizabeth , to use granddaddy’s words , wed her second , having killed her first .	653707190.7001854
o , yes , mention there is .	3.4832295029171263
in the years when he was living richly in royal london to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’s shepherd .	355.1828029500617
explain you then .	1.2223984716939718
explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity .	6.893281181091855
he faced their silence .	1.4625960901361372
to whom thus eglinton you mean the will .	4.9250486317119115
but that has been explained , i believe , by jurists .	12.14574319048248
she was entitled to her widow’s dower at common law .	5.498142393756342
his legal knowledge was great our judges tell us .	4.799270516781674
him satan fleers , mocker and therefore he left out her name from the first draft but he did not leave out the presents for his granddaughter , for his daughters , for his sister , for his old cronies in stratford and in london .	83393.55280371936
and therefore when he was urged , as i believe , to name her he left her his secondbest bed .	124.85126807287173
punkt .	1
leftherhis secondbest leftherhis bestabed secabest leftabed .	1.6674002181070913
woa !	1
pretty countryfolk had few chattels then , john eglinton observed , as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type .	116.06178166261239
he was a rich country gentleman , stephen said , with a coat of arms and landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard , a capitalist shareholder , a bill promoter , a tithefarmer .	4815.441508070895
why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace ?	312.8276157188899
it is clear that there were two beds , a best and a secondbest , mr secondbest best said finely .	113.47835634758967
separatio a mensa et a thalamo bettered buck mulligan and was smiled on .	11.167819799031383
antiquity mentions famous beds , second eglinton puckered , bedsmiling .	5.3396946896033635
let me think .	1.4443716752164455
antiquity mentions that stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage , stephen said , who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves , pays tribute to his elders , wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress ( don’t forget nell gwynn herpyllis ) and let her live in his villa .	3937541.549368285
do you mean he died so ?	2.808573845786313
mr best asked with slight concern .	2.932668827973033
i mean.. .	1
he died dead drunk , buck mulligan capped .	3.0032949906795765
a quart of ale is a dish for a king .	9.143167294825753
o , i must tell you what dowden said !	5.048263577099293

william shakespeare and company , limited .	3.030147196862303
the people’s william .	1.22437047715332
for terms apply e. dowden , highfield house.. .	2.7202574781992417
lovely !	1
buck mulligan suspired amorously .	1.253225240973506
i asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard .	31.21153153554063
he lifted his hands and said all we can say is that life ran very high in those days .	73.80236934285583
lovely !	1
catamite .	1
the sense of beauty leads us astray , said beautifulinsadness best to ugling eglinton .	15.91253472363
steadfast john replied severe	1.222176510541947
the doctor can tell us what those words mean .	5.923068566804308
you cannot eat your cake and have it .	4.415526690672461
sayest thou so ?	1.234483734842394
will they wrest from us , from me , the palm of beauty ?	15.25331545704629
and the sense of property , stephen said .	3.532007043833625
he drew shylock out of his own long pocket .	3.8699989951269687
the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender , with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots .	211.4196627014619
his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing .	31.193238213557287
he sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent .	234.86365085049948
how else could aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick ?	5.397924681610122
all events brought grist to his mill .	2.7044507203843065
shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech lopez , his jew’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive hamlet and macbeth with the coming to the throne of a scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting .	51132.447029134855
the lost armada is his jeer in love’s labour lost .	6.184655353795571
his pageants , the histories , sail fullbellied on a tide of mafeking enthusiasm .	14.201247396803605
warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s theory of equivocation .	10.702043803581383
the sea venture comes home from bermudas and the play renan admired is written with patsy caliban , our american cousin .	79.17209519485897
the sugared sonnets follow sidney’s .	1.757050837286239
as for fay elizabeth , otherwise carrotty bess , the gross virgin who inspired the merry wives of windsor let some meinherr from almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket .	1776.538587568565
i think you’re getting on very nicely .	3.5275322421450235
just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological .	2.9494785142879163
mingo , minxi , mictum , mingere .	2.145588162809858
prove that he was a jew , john eglinton dared , expectantly .	9.180312603367595
your dean of studies holds he was a holy roman .	6.577742525388389
sufflaminandus sum .	1
he was made in germany , stephen replied , as the champion french polisher of italian scandals .	37.04663328438225
a myriadminded man , mr best reminded .	3.4426367650642598
coleridge called him myriadminded .	1.6355311694697707
amplius .	1
in societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos .	4.364494222329094
saint thomas , stephen began.. .	1.8749839068024863
ora pro nobis monk mulligan groaned , sinking to a chair .	7.919898599361713
there he keened a wailing rune .	1.9824596179989902
pogue mahone !	1
acushla machree !	1
it’s destroyed we are from this day !	3.7465052654262703
it’s destroyed we are surely !	2.0759189009263053
all smiled their smiles .	1.401127435369519
saint thomas , stephen smiling said , whose gorbellied works i enjoy reading in the original , writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new viennese school mr magee spoke of , likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions .	105237.76578584961
he means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who , it may be , hungers for it .	644.3830669569927
jews , whom christians tax with avarice , are of all races the most given to intermarriage .	34.81208185551941
accusations are made in anger .	2.234557139934719
the christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews ( for whom , as for the lollards , storm was shelter ) bound their affections too with hoops of steel .	1371.1873201956073
whether these be sins or virtues old nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet .	14.64655947298791
but a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife .	6277.026933664516
no sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass .	62.572204007044846
or his jennyass , buck mulligan antiphoned .	1.7167342646319972
gentle will is being roughly handled , gentle mr best said gently .	7.842567956596435
which will ?	1
gagged sweetly buck mulligan .	1.4907808285178197
we are getting mixed .	1.623326238605497
the will to live , john eglinton philosophised , for poor ann , will’s widow , is the will to die .	105.00054389787218
requiescat !	1
stephen prayed .	1
what of all the will to do ?	4.135949447678166
it has vanished long ago.. .	1.6897326820757135
she lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed , the mobled queen , even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes .	51807.96875927615
in old age she takes up with gospellers ( one stayed with her at new place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask ) and heard she had a soul .	83369.48902351124

why is the underplot of king lear in which edmund figures lifted out of sidney’s arcadia and spatchcocked on to a celtic legend older than history ?	228.05170235572143
that was will’s way , john eglinton defended .	3.4092915484992248

moore would say .	1.2057032749127945
he puts bohemia on the seacoast and makes ulysses quote aristotle .	5.560064240608737
why ?	1
stephen answered himself .	1.2006829698023118
because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to shakespeare , what the poor are not , always with him .	3987.7487266677463
the note of banishment , banishment from the heart , banishment from home , sounds uninterruptedly from the two gentlemen of verona onward till prospero breaks his staff , buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book .	9072.819513080352
it doubles itself in the middle of his life , reflects itself in another , repeats itself , protasis , epitasis , catastasis , catastrophe .	329.75049381188614
it repeats itself again when he is near the grave , when his married daughter susan , chip of the old block , is accused of adultery .	747.0141401168011
but it was the original sin that darkened his understanding , weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil .	203.3422110725384
the words are those of my lords bishops of maynooth .	8.322663005031886
an original sin and , like original sin , committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned .	86.7804001072987
it is between the lines of his last written words , it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid .	740.3527159304678
age has not withered it .	1.9064708362023601
beauty and peace have not done it away .	5.646528819278841
it is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created , in much ado about nothing twice in as you like it in the tempest in hamlet in measure for measure and in all the other plays which i have not read .	40008.01803907802

he is all in all .	2.6973589862907703

when all is said dumas fils ( or is it dumas père ?	9.073686615830423
is right .	1
after god shakespeare has created most .	2.736576493195601
man delights him not nor woman neither , stephen said .	6.732489397969056
he returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born , where he has always been , man and boy , a silent witness and there , his journey of life ended , he plants his mulberrytree in the earth .	157264.09235577012

and , what though murdered and betrayed , bewept by all frail tender hearts for , dane or dubliner , sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced .	2674.8746972349772
if you like the epilogue look long on it prosperous prospero , the good man rewarded , lizzie , grandpa’s lump of love , and nuncle richie , the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go .	53219.75064579211
strong curtain .	1
he found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible .	32.86599425540756
maeterlinck says if socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep .	39.53261630757723
if judas go forth tonight it is to judas his steps will tend .	11.181053674036768
every life is many days , day after day .	5.765830436093896
we walk through ourselves , meeting robbers , ghosts , giants , old men , young men , wives , widows , brothers-in-love , but always meeting ourselves .	381.52908183599004

virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered .	3.0693280704773285
near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman .	6.615365337810595
and now it was an office or something .	5.249765242219238
father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop .	616.8434441400217
father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter .	55.105353439444336
he passed grogan’s the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york .	32.73059013064088
in america those things were continually happening .	2.9726200170621673
unfortunate people to die like that , unprepared .	4.747893226768457
still , an act of perfect contrition .	3.313334057898273
father conmee went by daniel bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged .	23.027159504596575
they saluted him and were saluted .	2.9091538943211304
father conmee passed h. j. o’neill’s funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay .	126.58667406145125
a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable .	31.128341243273656
in youkstetter’s , the porkbutcher’s , father conmee observed pig’s puddings , white and black and red , lie neatly curled in tubes .	215.50994272412237
moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge , a towhorse with pendent head , a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships , smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him .	11685.804304050083
it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people .	36175.14886092529
on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s. j. of saint francis xavier’s church , upper gardiner street , stepped on to an outward bound tram .	321.7782599723114
off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c. c. of saint agatha’s church , north william street , on to newcomen bridge .	306.85692685259585
at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island .	186.06703527376027
father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar , a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove , while four shillings , a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse .	32566.74708013376
passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket .	97.7072522961167
the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap .	83.98071799035188
father conmee liked cheerful decorum .	1.7539308360707309
it was a peaceful day .	1.600242104797345
the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down .	19.654103941866296
his wife , father conmee supposed .	3.1757388062571317
a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses .	39.49628430779246
she raised her small gloved fist , yawned ever so gently , tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily , sweetly .	227.05527035043008
father conmee perceived her perfume in the car .	4.61282530681351
he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat .	104.89036857695844
father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head .	272.1733389870612
at annesley bridge the tram halted and , when it was about to go , an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight .	732.7779312151448
the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her .	10.353452321401427
she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that , as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare , she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you , my child that they have been absolved , pray for me .	57064792.35420903
but they had so many worries in life , so many cares , poor creatures .	34.23711422441205
from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee .	9.455014214300924
father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s. j. and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night .	3654587.720522371
that book by the belgian jesuit , le nombre des élus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea .	25.74302380111477
those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not ( d.v. ) been brought .	260.75192177014014
but they were god’s souls , created by god .	5.861532439009414
it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost , a waste , if one might say .	237.85936544643172
at the howth road stop father conmee alighted , was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn .	93.7767119471404
the malahide road was quiet .	1.8739211233412358
it pleased father conmee , road and name .	4.639742936705225
the joybells were ringing in gay malahide .	2.977455574517359
lord talbot de malahide , immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining .	16.205524652049355
then came the call to arms and she was maid , wife and widow in one day .	69.64154240677192
those were old worldish days , loyal times in joyous townlands , old times in the barony .	38.057372120740744
father conmee , walking , thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort , daughter of lord molesworth , first countess of belvedere .	24638.33565311258
a listless lady , no more young , walked alone the shore of lough ennel , mary , first countess of belvedere , listlessly walking in the evening , not startled when an otter plunged .	3816.1499707622684
who could know the truth ?	2.3975286634707174
not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully , eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husband’s brother ?	208.69210561900871
she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did .	16.99248954242875
only god knew and she and he , her husband’s brother .	16.564192851220636
father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence , needed however for man’s race on earth , and of the ways of god which were not our ways .	451.70371979141987
don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore .	10.809814273028316
he was humane and honoured there .	2.194277616618618
he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom , ceiled with full fruit clusters .	123.837066696922
and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom , noble to noble , were impalmed by don john conmee .	120.80712814627792
it was a charming day .	1.8090336189838687
the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages , curtseying to him with ample underleaves .	34.355250030518434
the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind .	22.629429870223177
moutonner the french said .	1.610342793106236
a just and homely word .	1.9578431665525022
father conmee , reading his office , watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey .	20.39623287017767
his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field .	8.584086433900383
he walked there , reading in the evening , and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play , young cries in the quiet evening .	1028.937964822819
he was their rector his reign was mild .	3.50305822912994
father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out .	10.607735157465111
an ivory bookmark told him the page .	3.6878080863672045
nones .	1
he should have read that before lunch .	3.965918907234866
but lady maxwell had come .	2.114414537938222
father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast .	10.569573869570043
deus in adiutorium .	1.1751800344309515
he walked calmly and read mutely the nones , walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ .	222.85945537618844
a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand .	724.7958938946042
the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig .	100.95023709825315
father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary .	17.368592297118095
sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum .	5.443328868697463
corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner .	93.56684326115571
he pulled himself erect , went to it and , spinning it on its axle , viewed its shape and brass furnishings .	128.91177877323938
chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway .	27.573575191748954
there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase , looking idly out .	76.69639394521978
father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge .	8.279076755989585
corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed , his hat downtilted , chewing his blade of hay .	38.776319754399985
constable 57c , on his beat , stood to pass the time of day .	45.170873333198664
that’s a fine day , mr kelleher .	4.157559252948602
ay , corny kelleher said .	1.385004180138877
it’s very close , the constable said .	3.9453641054986774
corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin .	496.3718340434935
what’s the best news ?	1.2927468117568905
he asked .	1
i seen that particular party last evening , the constable said with bated breath .	19.157184666184715
a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnell’s corner , skirting rabaiotti’s icecream car , and jerked himself up eccles street .	43.720528142511746
towards larry o’rourke , in shirtsleeves in his doorway , he growled unamiably	21.016644102186998
for england .. .	1.0032185850997664
he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus , halted and growled	15.748682953261605
home and beauty .	1.0504352685850342
j. j. o’molloy’s white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor .	48.90513109265099
a stout lady stopped , took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her .	154.77945173905422
the sailor grumbled thanks , glanced sourly at the unheeding windows , sank his head and swung himself forward four strides .	108.62137134934859
he halted and growled angrily	1.6837240948313634
for england .. .	1.0032185850997664
two barefoot urchins , sucking long liquorice laces , halted near him , gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths .	93.05233895780924
he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks , halted , lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply	94.72937679504739
home and beauty .	1.0504352685850342
the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two , ceased .	19.672837773255846
the blind of the window was drawn aside .	4.620929870872298
a card unfurnished apartments slipped from the sash and fell .	6.1065364701947225
a plump bare generous arm shone , was seen , held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps .	69.23135577947083
a woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings .	8.043916683239129
it fell on the path .	2.403744940909306
one of the urchins ran to it , picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap , saying	39.04885464953147
there , sir .	1.2499939467782115
katey and boody dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen .	9.082373063116766
did you put in the books ?	3.2791740780733716
boody asked .	1
maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow .	58.70802876690854
they wouldn’t give anything on them , she said .	6.98671318069959
father conmee walked through clongowes fields , his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble .	15.6041626325819
where did you try ?	1.9615078903657397
boody asked .	1
m’guinness’s .	1
boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table .	12.740514357602693
bad cess to her big face !	2.6796809168446725
she cried .	1
katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes .	6.562016839016752
what’s in the pot ?	1.953217539045611
she asked .	1
shirts , maggy said .	1.0952119936834779
boody cried angrily	1
crickey , is there nothing for us to eat ?	8.351732004194886
katey , lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt , asked	17.61579908463039
and what’s in this ?	1.9475714351491769
a heavy fume gushed in answer .	2.194251494328889
peasoup , maggy said .	1.0952119936834779
where did you get it ?	2.824147347442949
katey asked .	1
sister mary patrick , maggy said .	1.8255585453310346
the lacquey rang his bell .	1.7596188488573599
barang !	1
boody sat down at the table and said hungrily	6.856099152096946
give us it here .	1.3558018649732788
maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl .	10.13976054117025
katey , sitting opposite boody , said quietly , as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs	58.33068057798296
a good job we have that much .	4.293856263203788
where’s dilly ?	1
gone to meet father , maggy said .	2.630651578470138
boody , breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup , added	17.05848758889169
our father who art not in heaven .	4.1374341372613985
maggy , pouring yellow soup in katey’s bowl , exclaimed	5.19443022547681
boody !	1
for shame !	1
a skiff , a crumpled throwaway , elijah is coming , rode lightly down the liffey , under loopline bridge , shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers , sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains , between the customhouse old dock and george’s quay .	19974.01121385106
the blond girl in thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre .	6.990991065729075
blazes boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar .	28.70294587070386
put these in first , will you ?	3.3091565888656826
he said .	1
yes , sir , the blond girl said .	4.379141951222369
and the fruit on top .	2.2143263990740993
that’ll do , game ball , blazes boylan said .	5.391035514876947
she bestowed fat pears neatly , head by tail , and among them ripe shamefaced peaches .	29.611331257140918
blazes boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop , lifting fruits , young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes , sniffing smells .	413.7383298795009
h. e. l. y.’s filed before him , tallwhitehatted , past tangier lane , plodding towards their goal .	41.233128058608614
he turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries , drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain’s length .	204.5832838152494
can you send them by tram ?	3.053252789628672
now ?	1
a darkbacked figure under merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s cart .	5.659408461339614
certainly , sir .	1.1707060181813362

ten minutes .	1
the blond girl handed him a docket and pencil .	6.487833911134495
will you write the address , sir ?	4.442506827315989
blazes boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her .	12.03781922882437

he said .	1

yes , sir .	1.3430405722750218
i will , sir .	1.5733907589988032
blazes boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket .	7.025353158753873
what’s the damage ?	1.1230690951215554
he asked .	1
the blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits .	3.6477077207331745
blazes boylan looked into the cut of her blouse .	6.897185606547447
a young pullet .	1.1150300427930042
he took a red carnation from the tall stemglass .	5.124568199517428
this for me ?	1.382945998905287
he asked gallantly .	1.1751800344309515
the blond girl glanced sideways at him , got up regardless , with his tie a bit crooked , blushing .	105.42941819485767
yes , sir , she said .	2.428227547427136
bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches .	5.230489878925154
blazes boylan looked in her blouse with more favour , the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth .	113.85326750234694
may i say a word to your telephone , missy ?	9.18803346026722
he asked roguishly .	1.1150300427930042
ma !	1
almidano artifoni said .	1.3779141386041656
he gazed over stephen’s shoulder at goldsmith’s knobby poll .	4.200004666992687
two carfuls of tourists passed slowly , their women sitting fore , gripping the handrests .	17.366945041553198
palefaces .	1
men’s arms frankly round their stunted forms .	2.852077214010239
they looked from trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of ireland where pigeons roocoocooed .	31.0625762188051
anch’io ho avuto di queste idee almidano artifoni said , quand’ ero giovine come lei .	9.372363021555449
eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia .	3.41062867007898
è peccato .	1
perchè la sua voce.. .	1.319941626268387
sarebbe un cespite di rendita , via .	2.1377113749013175
invece , lei si sacrifica .	1.6510343639410696
sacrifizio incruento stephen said smiling , swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint , lightly .	55.36020005814081
speriamo the round mustachioed face said pleasantly .	2.7782375006398983
ma , dia retta a me .	1.8718746277026443
ci rifletta .	1
by the stern stone hand of grattan , bidding halt , an inchicore tram unloaded straggling highland soldiers of a band .	77.42505405877199
ci rifletterò stephen said , glancing down the solid trouserleg .	5.260931187248769
ma , sul serio , eh ?	1.6634316182403146
almidano artifoni said .	1.3779141386041656
his heavy hand took stephen’s firmly .	2.2599458405198813
human eyes .	1
they gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a dalkey tram .	12.010598171415031
eccolo almidano artifoni said in friendly haste .	3.682308180533373
venga a trovarmi e ci pensi .	1.8765126580063527
addio , caro .	1.1886369485030743

almidano artifoni said .	1.3779141386041656
scusi , eh ?	1.0671936222256428
tante belle cose !	1.1233139458511303
almidano artifoni , holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal , trotted on stout trousers after the dalkey tram .	149.63442066075476
in vain he trotted , signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through trinity gates .	49.663583273363514
miss dunne hid the capel street library copy of the woman in white far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter .	618.3377075348748
too much mystery business in it .	2.5257576537766577
is he in love with that one , marion ?	8.372808501651226
change it and get another by mary cecil haye .	5.212766399950843
the disk shot down the groove , wobbled a while , ceased and ogled them six .	11.316193640535579

five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between monypeny’s corner and the slab where wolfe tone’s statue was not , eeled themselves turning h. e. l. y.’s and plodded back as they had come .	713.4972345712712

mustard hair and dauby cheeks .	2.144178707803788

the vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall .	47.18377968285364
at their feet its red speck died and mouldy air closed round them .	11.822126394319874
how interesting !	1
a refined accent said in the gloom .	4.577125405571606

in the still faint light he moved about , tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor .	251.3654691561776
from a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard .	15.552822109925057

he followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars .	35.069058590512505
with j. j. o’molloy he came forth slowly into mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal , o’connor , wexford .	165.16896000162802

the young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig .	8.301514636266473
i thought you were at a new gunpowder plot , j. j. o’molloy said .	18.490916992831632
ned lambert cracked his fingers in the air .	5.746446439518376
god !	1
he cried .	1
i forgot to tell him that one about the earl of kildare after he set fire to cashel cathedral .	103.39141186389246

i’m bloody sorry i did it says he , but i declare to god i thought the archbishop was inside .	156.69865535472712

the horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness .	6.413720015201138
he slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried	5.075803564530722
woa , sonny !	1.1233139458511303
he turned to j. j. o’molloy and asked	1.9577758478140643

with gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and , after an instant , sneezed loudly .	86.97896663728245

he slid it into the left slot for them .	4.998282481465126
it shot down the groove , wobbled a while , ceased , ogling them six .	9.895685880330918
lawyers of the past , haughty , pleading , beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to nisi prius court richie goulding carrying the costbag of goulding , collis and ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude .	1477336.9430821468

so a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over .	55.969707450748295
see ?	1
tom rochford said .	1.068274886245904
he slid in a disk for himself and watched it shoot , wobble , ogle , stop four .	45.09902902487912
turn now on .	1.1376808665433746
i’ll see him now in the ormond , lenehan said , and sound him .	22.09373012517944

goodnight , m’coy said abruptly .	1.716780937984457
when you two begin.. .	1.5266051570611725
nosey flynn stooped towards the lever , snuffling at it .	6.608062738925333
but how does it work here , tommy ?	5.171409903116747
he asked .	1
tooraloo , lenehan said .	1.6500847996696455
see you later .	1.2232350384847155
he followed m’coy out across the tiny square of crampton court .	7.447804998610793
he’s a hero , he said simply .	2.349694233994314
i know , m’coy said .	2.277056335858554
the drain , you mean .	2.4756944032140473
drain ?	1
lenehan said .	1
it was down a manhole .	2.220995858170168
they passed dan lowry’s musichall where marie kendall , charming soubrette , smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile .	63.9286679726997
going down the path of sycamore street beside the empire musichall lenehan showed m’coy how the whole thing was .	98.98986688270233
one of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it , half choked with sewer gas .	229.45521440907552
down went tom rochford anyhow , booky’s vest and all , with the rope round him .	37.779649902830386
and be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up .	120.96962900267967
the act of a hero , he said .	5.434623444978787
at the dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for jervis street .	27.88157181313672
this way , he said , walking to the right .	7.593796769928369
i want to pop into lynam’s to see sceptre’s starting price .	5.472459848731539
what’s the time by your gold watch and chain ?	7.913686323792858
m’coy peered into marcus tertius moses’ sombre office , then at o’neill’s clock .	11.569291004165647
after three , he said .	2.515759847172761
who’s riding her ?	1.2397468497025383
o. madden , lenehan said .	2.2921566776555555
and a game filly she is .	2.5575876079099062
while he waited in temple bar m’coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter .	131.29732282125687
fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark .	28.5220503303535
the gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade .	24.319483823954197
even money , lenehan said returning .	2.4396468369756583
i knocked against bantam lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly .	123.25718041667903
through here .	1
they went up the steps and under merchants’ arch .	7.410049041493837
a darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart .	2.998154885750972
there he is , lenehan said .	2.878777700899787
wonder what he’s buying , m’coy said , glancing behind .	6.284459599411444
leopoldo or the bloom is on the rye lenehan said .	8.668578767759186
he’s dead nuts on sales , m’coy said .	3.622451565065205
i was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in liffey street for two bob .	344.39718855496716
there were fine plates in it worth double the money , the stars and the moon and comets with long tails .	195.70780725722295
astronomy it was about .	2.031014567873037
lenehan laughed .	1
i’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails , he said .	20.14084744176449
come over in the sun .	2.6636133900144667
they crossed to the metal bridge and went along wellington quay by the riverwall .	23.055674800800332
master patrick aloysius dignam came out of mangan’s , late fehrenbach’s , carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks .	44.35129557536594
there was a long spread out at glencree reformatory , lenehan said eagerly .	10.028723839038777
the annual dinner , you know .	2.998379137032461
boiled shirt affair .	1.1919481431085317
the lord mayor was there , val dillon it was , and sir charles cameron and dan dawson spoke and there was music .	171.71780467422022
bartell d’arcy sang and benjamin dollard.. .	2.0526646859152295
i know , m’coy broke in .	3.1617634984873
my missus sang there once .	2.007301777494172
did she ?	1
lenehan said .	1
a card unfurnished apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 eccles street .	9.425927591821644
he checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh .	14.848828575871723
but wait till i tell you , he said .	5.192285076648922
delahunt of camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher .	9.07377315390211
bloom and the wife were there .	2.930957910553689
lashings of stuff we put up port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice .	46.520105039132
fast and furious it was .	2.0634666311525534
after liquids came solids .	1.382361864535056
cold joints galore and mince pies.. .	1.9347639407091348
i know , m’coy said .	2.277056335858554
the year the missus was there.. .	2.569295759467352
lenehan linked his arm warmly .	1.8470603540592179
but wait till i tell you , he said .	5.192285076648922
we had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before .	511.58538300501266
coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the featherbed mountain .	6.679876021345267
bloom and chris callinan were on one side of the car and i was with the wife on the other .	194.91057229965668
we started singing glees and duets lo , the early beam of morning .	10.77838796711836
she was well primed with a good load of delahunt’s port under her bellyband .	12.74225363381239
every jolt the bloody car gave i had her bumping up against me .	19.035054994073757
hell’s delights !	1
she has a fine pair , god bless her .	7.382900835650843
like that .	1
he held his caved hands a cubit from him , frowning	6.281721308856798
i was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time .	19.5412658927698
know what i mean ?	2.078809814266704
his hands moulded ample curves of air .	3.240748209899058
he shut his eyes tight in delight , his body shrinking , and blew a sweet chirp from his lips .	120.81482613328913
the lad stood to attention anyhow , he said with a sigh .	11.8982488551842
she’s a gamey mare and no mistake .	3.4345930537882343
bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to chris callinan and the jarvey the great bear and hercules and the dragon , and the whole jingbang lot .	2088.201008534265
but , by god , i was lost , so to speak , in the milky way .	54.499171193277114
he knows them all , faith .	2.543281413324629
at last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away .	4.8032335972868
and what star is that , poldy ?	3.8091347401602387
says she .	1
by god , she had bloom cornered .	2.780157627359131
that one , is it ?	2.0259549226566875
says chris callinan , sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick .	17.343748197571962
by god , he wasn’t far wide of the mark .	8.336198455960645
lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall , panting with soft laughter .	10.426953875891224
i’m weak , he gasped .	2.2220767158632735
m’coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave .	9.491854927123555
lenehan walked on again .	1.9920292706138953
he lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly .	3.912850998216812
he glanced sideways in the sunlight at m’coy .	4.490142713856761
he’s a cultured allroundman , bloom is , he said seriously .	6.894302730561392
he’s not one of your common or garden.. .	3.9483413274395014
you know.. .	1
there’s a touch of the artist about old bloom .	6.455168470059638
mr bloom turned over idly pages of the awful disclosures of maria monk then of aristotle’s masterpiece .	28.138068999096852
crooked botched print .	1.2100780207722248
plates infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows .	13.218727328934762
lots of them like that at this moment all over the world .	19.549796003920658
all butting with their skulls to get out of it .	11.1245974265305
child born every minute somewhere .	2.057416530993454
mrs purefoy .	1
he laid both books aside and glanced at the third tales of the ghetto by leopold von sacher masoch .	41.79857027095514
that i had , he said , pushing it by .	8.581644098348958
the shopman let two volumes fall on the counter .	5.423106644240395
them are two good ones , he said .	5.295326678601796
onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth .	15.518996889755316
he bent to make a bundle of the other books , hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain .	260.1746920051216
on o’connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of mr denis j maginni , professor of dancing &c .	53.13428102316623
mr bloom , alone , looked at the titles .	5.962132880484222

the shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face , coughing .	22.394549551363482
he raked his throat rudely , puked phlegm on the floor .	8.984811883935638

the lacquey rang his bell behind their backs .	3.4863006192970314
barang !	1
curse your bloody blatant soul , mr dedalus cried , turning on him .	18.389953461056326

mr dedalus stared at him .	2.3037762161729205

the lacquey banged loudly .	1.398520245991967
mr dedalus amid the din walked off , murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently	33.82857107991049

most scandalous revelation .	1.1150300427930042
not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst .	6.865578639277832
what i can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that.. .	15.239310732136941

how are things ?	1.380600473983413
hello , bob , old man , mr dedalus answered , stopping .	10.312440070719454
they clasped hands loudly outside reddy and daughter’s .	3.1350537996141665
father cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand .	5.991408103142487
what’s the best news ?	1.2927468117568905
mr dedalus said .	1.4235138247367836
why then not much , father cowley said .	5.714565881640179
i’m barricaded up , simon , with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance .	57.03882608753117
jolly , mr dedalus said .	2.3952498039842784
who is it ?	1.2940683633648582
o , father cowley said .	2.452527755922635
a certain gombeen man of our acquaintance .	3.5747513127894504
with a broken back , is it ?	3.8294489037745802
mr dedalus asked .	1.1898416795494093
the same , simon , father cowley answered .	3.7173094919303726
reuben of that ilk .	1.5750759227668159
i’m just waiting for ben dollard .	2.6685841720051227
he’s going to say a word to long john to get him to take those two men off .	105.00885356140977
all i want is a little time .	3.6008283711178337
he looked with vague hope up and down the quay , a big apple bulging in his neck .	82.60113245509011
i know , mr dedalus said , nodding .	5.245271186443966
poor old bockedy ben !	1.3887390603728285
he’s always doing a good turn for someone .	5.64557186892132
hold hard !	1
he put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant .	17.728820705598068
there he is , by god , he said , arse and pockets .	18.928961853759347
ben dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge .	82.35791727899455
he came towards them at an amble , scratching actively behind his coattails .	11.617248669557647
as he came near mr dedalus greeted	3.289245358327751
hold that fellow with the bad trousers .	3.4239301448361825
hold him now , ben dollard said .	4.6588113393738
mr dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of ben dollard’s figure .	14.081233185739263
then , turning to father cowley with a nod , he muttered sneeringly	26.588248326612213
that’s a pretty garment , isn’t it , for a summer’s day ?	11.249958846023056
why , god eternally curse your soul , ben dollard growled furiously , i threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw .	470.7822164884926
he stood beside them beaming , on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff , saying	254.56645892016354
they were made for a man in his health , ben , anyhow .	21.518998394201283
bad luck to the jewman that made them , ben dollard said .	18.360351829945262
thanks be to god he’s not paid yet .	5.010422918050556
and how is that basso profondo benjamin ?	2.814482625639866
father cowley asked .	1.1490448761656116
cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell , murmuring , glassyeyed , strode past the kildare street club .	25.09302416250827
ben dollard frowned and , making suddenly a chanter’s mouth , gave forth a deep note .	32.81290771417751
aw !	1
he said .	1
that’s the style , mr dedalus said , nodding to its drone .	14.560164861523317
what about that ?	1.3410508777825862
ben dollard said .	1.2968604187275619
not too dusty ?	1.227721017594151
what ?	1
he turned to both .	1.5335568693813495
that’ll do , father cowley said , nodding also .	7.124257344657683
the reverend hugh c. love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint mary’s abbey past james and charles kennedy’s , rectifiers , attended by geraldines tall and personable , towards the tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles .	1581.4348061506416
ben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward , his joyful fingers in the air .	95.80397375609932
come along with me to the subsheriff’s office , he said .	15.730836784727401
i want to show you the new beauty rock has for a bailiff .	17.967341180640176
he’s a cross between lobengula and lynchehaun .	2.3728768893026655
he’s well worth seeing , mind you .	4.080720040176762
come along .	1
i saw john henry menton casually in the bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if i don’t.. .	93.82834824096962
wait awhile.. .	1
we’re on the right lay , bob , believe you me .	10.026517362343503
for a few days tell him , father cowley said anxiously .	10.704503224409414
ben dollard halted and stared , his loud orifice open , a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright .	4357.192807031223
what few days ?	1.3391459460090858
he boomed .	1
hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent ?	2.2624090086610114
he has , father cowley said .	3.144417077447186
then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on , ben dollard said .	46.334450418082724
the landlord has the prior claim .	2.4103998157699666
i gave him all the particulars .	2.5533787662477185
29 windsor avenue .	1.176616214717253
love is the name ?	1.9832428452653448
that’s right , father cowley said .	3.0915327095319896
the reverend mr love .	1.745774334158251
he’s a minister in the country somewhere .	3.1460840116546542
but are you sure of that ?	3.690603765985652
you can tell barabbas from me , ben dollard said , that he can put that writ where jacko put the nuts .	226.74211057517613
he led father cowley boldly forward , linked to his bulk .	9.812690857944423
filberts i believe they were , mr dedalus said , as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront , following them .	149.7212227407836
the youngster will be all right , martin cunningham said , as they passed out of the castleyard gate .	55.55329429477196
the policeman touched his forehead .	2.2393661770994697
god bless you , martin cunningham said , cheerily .	4.245228332219917
he signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards lord edward street .	53.313741971425266
bronze by gold , miss kennedy’s head by miss douce’s head , appeared above the crossblind of the ormond hotel .	105.17582534337562
yes , martin cunningham said , fingering his beard .	4.805768186158891
i wrote to father conmee and laid the whole case before him .	17.46186422491566
you could try our friend , mr power suggested backward .	6.728523041048045
boyd ?	1
martin cunningham said shortly .	1.1915170724999617
touch me not .	1.2771405044707886
john wyse nolan , lagging behind , reading the list , came after them quickly down cork hill .	69.32178753511445
on the steps of the city hall councillor nannetti , descending , hailed alderman cowley and councillor abraham lyon ascending .	62.56643176095565
the castle car wheeled empty into upper exchange street .	4.784973335567569
look here , martin , john wyse nolan said , overtaking them at the mail office .	36.85904101818095
i see bloom put his name down for five shillings .	7.096616106225945
quite right , martin cunningham said , taking the list .	7.903040460669788
and put down the five shillings too .	4.318405833549111
without a second word either , mr power said .	6.636287723689732
strange but true , martin cunningham added .	2.2537935797057047
john wyse nolan opened wide eyes .	2.3523508580981396
i’ll say there is much kindness in the jew , he quoted , elegantly .	18.544134276987535
they went down parliament street .	2.2198972013530645
there’s jimmy henry , mr power said , just heading for kavanagh’s .	13.986340707308232
righto , martin cunningham said .	1.8175432565868803
here goes .	1
outside la maison claire blazes boylan waylaid jack mooney’s brother-in-law , humpy , tight , making for the liberties .	53.213200771428426
john wyse nolan fell back with mr power , while martin cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit , who walked uncertainly , with hasty steps past micky anderson’s watches .	7914.350349734074
the assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble , john wyse nolan told mr power .	37.216912681976986
they followed round the corner towards james kavanagh’s winerooms .	4.717118282639628
the empty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate .	7.814542008410857
martin cunningham , speaking always , showed often the list at which jimmy henry did not glance .	42.95797488607105
and long john fanning is here too , john wyse nolan said , as large as life .	40.767199527826584
the tall form of long john fanning filled the doorway where he stood .	18.685872673501972
good day , mr subsheriff , martin cunningham said , as all halted and greeted .	22.907549271217132
long john fanning made no way for them .	4.216697044823946
he removed his large henry clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces .	47.13353783985465
are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations ?	2.7430084685828087
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk .	8.644624273558394
hell open to christians they were having , jimmy henry said pettishly , about their damned irish language .	42.15655794679565
where was the marshal , he wanted to know , to keep order in the council chamber .	78.47939919858304
and old barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma , no mace on the table , nothing in order , no quorum even , and hutchinson , the lord mayor , in llandudno and little lorcan sherlock doing locum tenens for him .	21323.380798657112
damned irish language , language of our forefathers .	4.791299102387564
long john fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips .	9.145431394886856
martin cunningham spoke by turns , twirling the peak of his beard , to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff , while john wyse nolan held his peace .	525.4033941213193
what dignam was that ?	1.7269416274835694
long john fanning asked .	1.419887651596787
jimmy henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot .	9.877077877012804
o , my corns !	1.501810592034884
he said plaintively .	1.1410998861782202
come upstairs for goodness’ sake till i sit down somewhere .	6.310552337215925
uff !	1
ooo !	1
mind !	1
testily he made room for himself beside long john fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs .	78.206811074518
come on up , martin cunningham said to the subsheriff .	6.213755456340602
i don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did , though .	20.143992960842116
with john wyse nolan mr power followed them in .	6.833788572430617
decent little soul he was , mr power said to the stalwart back of long john fanning ascending towards long john fanning in the mirror .	240.48440211323594
rather lowsized .	1
dignam of menton’s office that was , martin cunningham said .	6.467042771132898
long john fanning could not remember him .	3.4586528374031875
clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air .	2.9452281929589508
what’s that ?	1
martin cunningham said .	1.3807132910053428
all turned where they stood .	2.2596936150744424
john wyse nolan came down again .	2.300840126084665
from the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street , harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering .	125.227686640739
gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes , not quickly .	13.251924762882025
in saddles of the leaders , leaping leaders , rode outriders .	8.604680393971561
what was it ?	1.3442467839287588
martin cunningham asked , as they went on up the staircase .	22.285173461702115
the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland , john wyse nolan answered from the stairfoot .	14.229190633404585
as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his panama to haines	19.495359993526016
parnell’s brother .	1
there in the corner .	1.990729693199137
they chose a small table near the window , opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard .	163.71943833918039
is that he ?	1.417146637202849
haines asked , twisting round in his seat .	5.865974942711185
yes , mulligan said .	1.769361064865855
that’s john howard , his brother , our city marshal .	10.577964015163458
john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested .	138.37596911510818
an instant after , under its screen , his eyes looked quickly , ghostbright , at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner .	602.4711976768328
i’ll take a mélange haines said to the waitress .	5.837538959116112
two mélanges buck mulligan said .	1.786704231748934
and bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well .	14.348598745650662
when she had gone he said , laughing	3.441909579411838
we call it d.b.c. because they have damn bad cakes .	8.151471711112576
o , but you missed dedalus on hamlet .	4.848268804257662
haines opened his newbought book .	1.8573229497594352

buck mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter .	5.023233154511323
you should see him , he said , when his body loses its balance .	22.64732548229173
wandering ængus i call him .	2.098215189784548
i am sure he has an idée fixe haines said , pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger .	48.15516743913097
now i am speculating what it would be likely to be .	8.01805751650168
such persons always have .	1.5770250952316145
buck mulligan bent across the table gravely .	4.600986244894838
they drove his wits astray , he said , by visions of hell .	14.065850917259205
he will never capture the attic note .	2.7380375817935136
the note of swinburne , of all poets , the white death and the ruddy birth .	31.725593808704993
that is his tragedy .	1.726882633453034
he can never be a poet .	3.287633966874913

i see .	1
i tackled him this morning on belief .	3.637696646081449
there was something on his mind , i saw .	11.152267546086824
it’s rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an interesting point out of that .	22.038142370992897
buck mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come .	4.104246473041865
he helped her to unload her tray .	2.8715631216573723
he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth , haines said , amid the cheerful cups .	56.570801699747975
the moral idea seems lacking , the sense of destiny , of retribution .	11.243409679291291
rather strange he should have just that fixed idea .	7.193521376826051
does he write anything for your movement ?	3.617236936693971
he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream .	9.416721259501458
buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith .	15.141327794094101
he bit off a soft piece hungrily .	3.9825111535259894
ten years , he said , chewing and laughing .	6.013133144031552
he is going to write something in ten years .	6.962654219196842
seems a long way off , haines said , thoughtfully lifting his spoon .	15.775177307838097
still , i shouldn’t wonder if he did after all .	7.860279344188091
he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup .	8.56768843714693
this is real irish cream i take it , he said with forbearance .	10.894001669077504
i don’t want to be imposed on .	3.4234936144060777
elijah , skiff , light crumpled throwaway , sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers , amid an archipelago of corks , beyond new wapping street past benson’s ferry , and by the threemasted schooner rosevean from bridgwater with bricks .	3349.1897981311795
almidano artifoni walked past holles street , past sewell’s yard .	6.285086583523766
behind him cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell , with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling , shunned the lamp before mr law smith’s house and , crossing , walked along merrion square .	324.6426142882041
distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of college park .	55.17365673670221
cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell walked as far as mr lewis werner’s cheerful windows , then turned and strode back along merrion square , his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling .	242.14903690219296
at the corner of wilde’s house he halted , frowned at elijah’s name announced on the metropolitan hall , frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn .	431.6911057429541
his eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun .	3.5561320212181275
with ratsteeth bared he muttered	1.518231382973285
coactus volui .	1
he strode on for clare street , grinding his fierce word .	9.703751604718954
as he strode past mr bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards , having buffeted a thewless body .	790.1571574267447
the blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form .	9.045892419820905
god’s curse on you , he said sourly , whoever you are !	6.708900296907978
you’re blinder nor i am , you bitch’s bastard !	6.689995765874506
opposite ruggy o’donohoe’s master patrick aloysius dignam , pawing the pound and a half of mangan’s , late fehrenbach’s , porksteaks he had been sent for , went along warm wicklow street dawdling .	751.433917082273
it was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with mrs stoer and mrs quigley and mrs macdowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle barney brought from tunney’s .	17811.19939336204
and they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake , jawing the whole blooming time and sighing .	20.264823465587316
after wicklow lane the window of madame doyle , courtdress milliner , stopped him .	13.691656880206217
he stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props .	51.741616496859976
from the sidemirrors two mourning masters dignam gaped silently .	3.5292178798042904
myler keogh , dublin’s pet lamb , will meet sergeantmajor bennett , the portobello bruiser , for a purse of fifty sovereigns .	101.04902978437032
gob , that’d be a good pucking match to see .	7.276281215320982
myler keogh , that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash .	34.64305503869302
two bar entrance , soldiers half price .	2.585658527320817
i could easy do a bunk on ma .	3.7381577735717886
master dignam on his left turned as he turned .	7.0217800209356485
that’s me in mourning .	1.8878155909134693
when is it ?	1.4358029697860957
may the twentysecond .	1.1150300427930042
sure , the blooming thing is all over .	5.98009402028474
he turned to the right and on his right master dignam turned , his cap awry , his collar sticking up .	252.541998729217
buttoning it down , his chin lifted , he saw the image of marie kendall , charming soubrette , beside the two puckers .	151.17976036835412
one of them mots that do be in the packets of fags stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out .	798.4426809334229
master dignam got his collar down and dawdled on .	5.971417593005621
the best pucker going for strength was fitzsimons .	4.620205707301572
one puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week , man .	84.52184401359025
but the best pucker for science was jem corbet before fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him , dodging and all .	74.95657297235766
in grafton street master dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time .	14367.84149260167
no sandymount tram .	1.1896496987662688
master dignam walked along nassau street , shifted the porksteaks to his other hand .	20.788956891087604
his collar sprang up again and he tugged it down .	9.671493210211626
the blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt , blooming end to it .	42.85583085778735
he met schoolboys with satchels .	1.7849578421818495
i’m not going tomorrow either , stay away till monday .	7.188337989562078
he met other schoolboys .	1.4898535392713075
do they notice i’m in mourning ?	2.8048762705131987
uncle barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight .	7.5976383791029765
then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name .	37.02202981426033
his face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye .	333.8415207882758
the scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs .	131.93432970172455
pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle barney telling the men how to get it round the bend .	338.1727782617142
a big coffin it was , and high and heavylooking .	9.012095415978623
how was that ?	1.3973798993895146
the last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt .	9532.733513131363
never see him again .	1.5967375060803588
death , that is .	1.9173609625374668
pa is dead .	1.2007355670927442
my father is dead .	1.609660692885263
he told me to be a good son to ma .	7.7792214300504225
i couldn’t hear the other things he said but i saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better .	276.1655325132697
poor pa .	1
that was mr dignam , my father .	4.964909522559045
i hope he’s in purgatory now because he went to confession to father conroy on saturday night .	61.83168738075428

says joe .	1
not taking anything between drinks , says i.	3.712932521756255

i want to give the citizen the hard word about it .	10.972081677927058
so we went around by the linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another .	93.08835621129627
decent fellow joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it .	38.5072240567509
jesus , i couldn’t get over that bloody foxy geraghty , the daylight robber .	24.462237905825194
for trading without a licence , says he .	4.756509508111997
in inisfail the fair there lies a land , the land of holy michan .	18.45422586533288
there rises a watchtower beheld of men afar .	4.0796700381462205
there sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept , warriors and princes of high renown .	39.57750895714905
a pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters , fishful streams where sport the gurnard , the plaice , the roach , the halibut , the gibbed haddock , the grilse , the dab , the brill , the flounder , the pollock , the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated .	796123.5500754425
in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage , the wafty sycamore , the lebanonian cedar , the exalted planetree , the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied .	85108.14781221312
lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots , silvery fishes , crans of herrings , drafts of eels , codlings , creels of fingerlings , purple seagems and playful insects .	145645.73540021764
and heroes voyage from afar to woo them , from eblana to slievemargy , the peerless princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruachan’s land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle , princes , the sons of kings .	178414.03670886406
and there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose , and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for o’connell fitzsimon takes toll of them , a chieftain descended from chieftains .	59675.159396291514
thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields , flaskets of cauliflowers , floats of spinach , pineapple chunks , rangoon beans , strikes of tomatoes , drums of figs , drills of swedes , spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale , york and savoy , and trays of onions , pearls of the earth , and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries , pulpy and pelurious , and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes .	2259764083.894014

come out here , geraghty , you notorious bloody hill and dale robber !	14.811802899327676
and by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves and there is ever heard a trampling , cackling , roaring , lowing , bleating , bellowing , rumbling , grunting , champing , chewing , of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy vales of thomond , from the m’gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly shannon the unfathomable , and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of kiar , their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds , various in size , the agate with this dun .	4.1697852678262824e+16
so we turned into barney kiernan’s and there , sure enough , was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel , garryowen , and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink .	147400.375493376
there he is , says i , in his gloryhole , with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers , working for the cause .	397.6741038038135
the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps .	25.279595006170325
be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog .	45.10494582373046
i’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence .	2428.1877017628635
stand and deliver , says he .	3.69749790681844
that’s all right , citizen , says joe .	4.189783448845015
friends here .	1
pass , friends , says he .	3.4204435567851146
then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he	12.550877729246398
what’s your opinion of the times ?	3.229064567386067
doing the rapparee and rory of the hill .	4.045074717662848
but , begob , joe was equal to the occasion .	8.42344960301802
i think the markets are on a rise , says he , sliding his hand down his fork .	67.41564054058438
so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says	14.978699225603748
foreign wars is the cause of it .	4.195713820558736
and says joe , sticking his thumb in his pocket	5.5346905056005316
it’s the russians wish to tyrannise .	2.414422999653808
arrah , give over your bloody codding , joe , says i. i’ve a thirst on me i wouldn’t sell for half a crown .	175.68537323335124
give it a name , citizen , says joe .	6.289779011303135

and how’s the old heart , citizen ?	4.483955783691678

what garry ?	1
are we going to win ?	2.6295239519911924
eh ?	1
and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and , by jesus , he near throttled him .	370.66607920157554
the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero .	706.5796598345734
from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered , as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible , with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus .	23087.1167349182
the widewinged nostrils , from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected , were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest .	749.5574524485991
the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower .	168.93281438472994
a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground , the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble .	198058.12397891528
he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes .	1519.3799068468825
beneath this he wore trews of deerskin , roughly stitched with gut .	7.2041835906229075
his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple , the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast .	539.7930751027205
from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity , cuchulin , conn of hundred battles , niall of nine hostages , brian of kincora , the ardri malachi , art macmurragh , shane o’neill , father john murphy , owen roe , patrick sarsfield , red hugh o’donnell , red jim macdermott , soggarth eoghan o’growney , michael dwyer , francy higgins , henry joy m’cracken , goliath , horace wheatley , thomas conneff , peg woffington , the village blacksmith , captain moonlight , captain boycott , dante alighieri , christopher columbus , s. fursa , s. brendan , marshal macmahon , charlemagne , theobald wolfe tone , the mother of the maccabees , the last of the mohicans , the rose of castile , the man for galway , the man that broke the bank at monte carlo , the man in the gap , the woman who didn’t , benjamin franklin , napoleon bonaparte , john l. sullivan , cleopatra , savourneen deelish , julius caesar , paracelsus , sir thomas lipton , william tell , michelangelo hayes , muhammad , the bride of lammermoor , peter the hermit , peter the packer , dark rosaleen , patrick w. shakespeare , brian confucius , murtagh gutenberg , patricio velasquez , captain nemo , tristan and isolde , the first prince of wales , thomas cook and son , the bold soldier boy , arrah na pogue , dick turpin , ludwig beethoven , the colleen bawn , waddler healy , angus the culdee , dolly mount , sidney parade , ben howth , valentine greatrakes , adam and eve , arthur wellesley , boss croker , herodotus , jack the giantkiller , gautama buddha , lady godiva , the lily of killarney , balor of the evil eye , the queen of sheba , acky nagle , joe nagle , alessandro volta , jeremiah o’donovan rossa , don philip o’sullivan beare .	1.1984066313810761e+33
a couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber , a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone .	636206.697273812
so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid .	530.0222217100209
o , as true as i’m telling you .	4.535026287002411

’twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze .	5.398784486939684

and lo , as they quaffed their cup of joy , a godlike messenger came swiftly in , radiant as the eye of heaven , a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance , bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage , fairest of her race .	6044266.408923049
little alf bergan popped in round the door and hid behind barney’s snug , squeezed up with the laughing .	68.51657772772312
and who was sitting up there in the corner that i hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only bob doran .	145.16048048945237

terence o’ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats , cunning as the sons of deathless leda .	5120.672500853063
for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil , those cunning brothers , lords of the vat .	67212.10492090123
then did you , chivalrous terence , hand forth , as to the manner born , that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted , the soul of chivalry , in beauty akin to the immortals .	18920.707112124404
but he , the young chief of the o’bergan’s , could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze .	509.110934976306
thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port , scion of the house of brunswick , victoria her name , her most excellent majesty , by grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the sea , queen , defender of the faith , empress of india , even she , who bore rule , a victress over many peoples , the wellbeloved , for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof , the pale , the dark , the ruddy and the ethiop .	948569031519.4563

says alf .	1
he’s no more dead than you are .	5.054614367296673
maybe so , says joe .	2.5360794123845047
they took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow .	6.858771288071875
paddy ?	1
says alf .	1
ay , says joe .	1.8268023661050792
he paid the debt of nature , god be merciful to him .	14.978950928111477
good christ !	1
says alf .	1
begob he was what you might call flabbergasted .	5.840012048876933
in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible , the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face .	426554.9180985523
communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus .	139.48540101275913
questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels .	14900.303422922389
in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them .	59475.92920568417
interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā , ālāvātār , hātākāldā , wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature .	865206.476919874
having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief .	11.611431035006012
asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power .	129899.04666478776
it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you , friends of earth , who are still in the body .	4716.227249421685
mind c. k. doesn’t pile it on .	3.159608108220767
it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher , manager of messrs h. j. o’neill’s popular funeral establishment , a personal friend of the defunct , who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements .	13177.192951218416
before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good .	452702.95543925324
he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known .	334.8090920565488
assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction .	71.42922909738672
he is gone from mortal haunts o’dignam , sun of our morning .	9.809111641604417
fleet was his foot on the bracken patrick of the beamy brow .	10.548730451534366
wail , banba , with your wind and wail , o ocean , with your whirlwind .	33.33901264496286
there he is again , says the citizen , staring out .	8.1852740775309
who ?	1
says i.	1
bloom , says he .	1.6909763787341652
he’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes .	12.763611234230542
and , begob , i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again .	45.375931643465464
little alf was knocked bawways .	1.8301131086346416
faith , he was .	1.8321860658401654
good christ !	1
says he .	1
i could have sworn it was him .	2.967690551828762
and says bob doran , with the hat on the back of his poll , lowest blackguard in dublin when he’s under the influence	357.2408701681807
who said christ is good ?	2.113246145061768
i beg your parsnips , says alf .	3.706110602479401
is that a good christ , says bob doran , to take away poor little willy dignam ?	59.3218884151688
ah , well , says alf , trying to pass it off .	12.305029533225568
he’s over all his troubles .	2.3243310494417977
but bob doran shouts out of him .	3.9295183262919524
he’s a bloody ruffian , i say , to take away poor little willy dignam .	30.021428168925908
terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet , that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises .	571.1045655071741
and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam , true as you’re there .	18.743597877195906
the finest man , says he , snivelling , the finest purest character .	15.43750225910081
the tear is bloody near your eye .	2.844280292644601
talking through his bloody hat .	2.3125700946169023
fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married , mooney , the bumbailiff’s daughter , mother kept a kip in hardwicke street , that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her , exposing her person , open to all comers , fair field and no favour .	18315520.04476966
the noblest , the truest , says he .	4.993043618151765
and he’s gone , poor little willy , poor little paddy dignam .	28.243568498576746
and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven .	31.003695786943254
old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door .	17.10375280613529
come in , come on , he won’t eat you , says the citizen .	23.430194325647072
so bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there .	74.35916963498248
o , christ m’keown , says joe , reading one of the letters .	12.273946188637815
listen to this , will you ?	2.8475564093781895
and he starts reading out one .	3.0250428669632106
7 hunter street , liverpool .	2.4520459973418194
to the high sheriff of dublin , dublin .	4.749265216977523
honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the 12 of febuary 1900 and i hanged.. .	313.9830357299158
show us , joe , says i.	2.4791358868532543
.. .	1
private arthur chace for fowl murder of jessie tilsit in pentonville prison and i was assistant when.. .	16.828717033810655
jesus , says i.	1.430614044675573
.. .	1
billington executed the awful murderer toad smith.. .	2.6817054030076326
the citizen made a grab at the letter .	4.717065654509662
hold hard , says joe , i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain , honoured sir , my terms is five ginnees .	4818.05138675012
h. rumbold , master barber .	2.0341741093850216
and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too , says the citizen .	10.184326384748323
and the dirty scrawl of the wretch , says joe .	7.9680792068093815
here , says he , take them to hell out of my sight , alf .	43.130772460659976
hello , bloom , says he , what will you have ?	12.426759088486477
so they started arguing about the point , bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar .	5475.595663404425
gob , he’s a prudent member and no mistake .	7.506449690185556
give us one of your prime stinkers , terry , says joe .	11.919890475227115
and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it .	106.32396828560962
they’re all barbers , says he , from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses .	220.90031611115378
and he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull .	31996.39771144996
in the dark land they bide , the vengeful knights of the razor .	9.637581186712934
their deadly coil they grasp yea , and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord .	1364.483644708811
so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on .	6802522.394235684
there’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on , says alf .	12.78634705893987
what’s that ?	1
says joe .	1
the poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged , says alf .	5.378806873036884
that so ?	1
says joe .	1
god’s truth , says alf .	2.451284198197485
i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady , the invincible .	67.32648668513767
he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker .	228.86331634515224
ruling passion strong in death , says joe , as someone said .	14.946814531545563
that can be explained by science , says bloom .	6.769395904321465
it’s only a natural phenomenon , don’t you see , because on account of the.. .	20.372164510943083
and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon .	48.54364387935553
the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would , according to the best approved tradition of medical science , be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus , thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis .	207808443286.31686
so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged , drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this , that and the other .	117998388.02179901
talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought .	46.91392031231245
mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs .	16.892736743630234
and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get .	262.4791615353752
so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him	9.558552358075858
give us the paw !	1.6815800435025656
give the paw , doggy !	1.877695225760781
good old doggy !	1.0826041457208833
give the paw here !	1.7272987217795823
give us the paw !	1.6815800435025656
arrah , bloody end to the paw he’d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip .	111413.64542096549
then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs’ tin he told terry to bring .	125.987411498486
gob , he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more .	145.39851328499512
near ate the tin and all , hungry bloody mongrel .	8.030554671773762
and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point , the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country , the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she’s far from the land .	26916.358797613888
and bloom , of course , with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face .	47.81839835479946
phenomenon !	1
the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley .	70.87466334072256
time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk .	666887587.292603
and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and , by the holy farmer , he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings , if the three women didn’t near roast him , it’s a queer story , the old one , bloom’s wife and mrs o’dowd that kept the hotel .	693862240.8879483
jesus , i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat .	23.75890323523844
and bloom with his but don’t you see ?	6.034595766051205
and but on the other hand .	3.5217212339821042
and sure , more be token , the lout i’m told was in power’s after , the blender’s , round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment .	77599.67356396806
phenomenon !	1
the memory of the dead , says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom .	32.24431782631334
ay , ay , says joe .	3.167166264358927
you don’t grasp my point , says bloom .	4.506884872386898
what i mean is.. .	1.4096521680055316
sinn fein !	1
says the citizen .	1.3426106192930234
sinn fein amhain !	1.1233139458511303
the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us .	24.875230973474153
the last farewell was affecting in the extreme .	3.5775442246198828
from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance .	1679.3010462484106
the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle .	764.45713147293
a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons .	521.4842792038545
a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza’s plaintive muse .	94457.94104905114
special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents .	158.58708884724618
considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l-n-h-n and m-ll-g-n who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion .	168.59956890923095
our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies .	3931.1827439525923
the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat .	341906.9384383091
the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite .	4698.072384749439
the delegation , present in full force , consisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone ( the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane ), monsieur pierrepaul petitépatant , the grandjoker vladinmire pokethankertscheff , the archjoker leopold rudolph von schwanzenbad-hodenthaler , countess marha virága kisászony putrápesthi , hiram y. bomboost , count athanatos karamelopulos , ali baba backsheesh rahat lokum effendi , señor hidalgo caballero don pecadillo y palabras y paternoster de la malora de la malaria , hokopoko harakiri , hi hung chang , olaf kobberkeddelsen , mynheer trik van trumps , pan poleaxe paddyrisky , goosepond prhklstr kratchinabritchisitch , borus hupinkoff , herr hurhausdirektorpresident hans chuechli-steuerli , nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor kriegfried ueberallgemein .	5978775383.103914
all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness .	186.10534466875808
an animated altercation ( in which all took part ) ensued among the f. o. t. e. i. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland’s patron saint .	5684.954370284072
in the course of the argument cannonballs , scimitars , boomerangs , blunderbusses , stinkpots , meatchoppers , umbrellas , catapults , knuckledusters , sandbags , lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged .	1040.1339175817598
the baby policeman , constable macfadden , summoned by special courier from booterstown , quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties .	1977.782459461074
the readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted .	13.770518183590905
constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the f. o. t. e. i. , several of whom were bleeding profusely .	50.26891209863283
commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair , it was explained by his legal adviser avvocato pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses .	110858.6220174746
the objects ( which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches ) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme .	242.5095102738711
quietly , unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower , the gladiolus cruentus .	73.7741341893494
he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough which so many have tried ( unsuccessfully ) to imitate short , painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man .	753.5773552476202
the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse , the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries , hoch , banzai , eljen , zivio , chinchin , polla kronia , hiphip , vive , allah amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song ( a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers ) was easily distinguishable .	767012334.1292537
it was exactly seventeen o’clock .	1.7642937822424205
the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared , the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero , which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi , being removed by his medical adviser in attendance , dr pippi .	109068.97153152603
the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater , his cassock above his hoary head , and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication .	246026.38205846003
hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner , his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously .	824.1882505161167
as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office .	6978.3300637598
on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife , the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances ( specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers , messrs john round and sons , sheffield ), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum , colon , blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim .	6478409.290204549
the housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution .	79.66885950315951
quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs , fried steak and onions , done to a nicety , delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he , with an abnegation rare in these our times , rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish ( immediately acceded to ) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem .	527472579536.8292
the nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake .	41199.43689908618
the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly sheila , my own .	25.111827008134178
encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach .	719.6187844063429
she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory , that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park .	809854.8945849503
she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and , oblivious of the dreadful present , they both laughed heartily , all the spectators , including the venerable pastor , joining in the general merriment .	693175.8817403383
that monster audience simply rocked with delight .	2.438540559010558
but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time .	32.75390328039778
a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people , touched to the inmost core , broke into heartrending sobs , not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself .	4181.16960390653
big strong men , officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary , were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage .	20798.728011915126
a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate , noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex , stepped forward and , presenting his visiting card , bankbook and genealogical tree , solicited the hand of the hapless young lady , requesting her to name the day , and was accepted on the spot .	804906.934056839
every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch , a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young oxonian ( the bearer , by the way , of one of the most timehonoured names in albion’s history ) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds .	279663929.5033204
nay , even the stern provostmarshal , lieutenantcolonel tomkin-maxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson , who presided on the sad occasion , he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching , could not now restrain his natural emotion .	10627.792356914193
with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard , by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone	1580.9793256026267
god blimey if she aint a clinker , that there bleeding tart .	13.101825743252862
blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry , straight , it does , when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down limehouse way .	2457.832580597698
so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink , the curse of ireland .	104476045.3264315
antitreating is about the size of it .	4.309255791088095
gob , he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint .	1166.000959235951
and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings , song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns , gob , flahoolagh entertainment , don’t be talking .	454755469.0876195
ireland sober is ireland free .	1.8695808198246011
and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of .	270.48282350972875
and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females , hitting below the belt .	190.1308205176319
so howandever , as i was saying , the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me .	252.99600489695712
i’d train him by kindness , so i would , if he was my dog .	39.58650774898031
give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him .	16.316989450041483
afraid he’ll bite you ?	1.5137260079408927
says the citizen , jeering .	1.9298402658588945
no , says i. but he might take my leg for a lamppost .	18.1694382450264
so he calls the old dog over .	4.573981661247906
what’s on you , garry ?	2.2026183355763167
says he .	1
then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling , letting on to answer , like a duet in the opera .	747.0303406457914
such growling you never heard as they let off between them .	13.38682286403409
someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that .	1379.0598271173178
growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws .	128.6794578405571
all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals ( and their name is legion ) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry .	2276101.0527428715
the exhibition , which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system , comprises , among other achievements , the recitation of verse .	574.4913013724149
our greatest living phonetic expert ( wild horses shall not drag it from us !	14.324640067821724
) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance ( the italics are ours ) to the ranns of ancient celtic bards .	3165.3283281540494
we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather ( as a contributor d. o. c. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary ) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye .	2386265548.762934
we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication .	17264.860545701755
the metrical system of the canine original , which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn , is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught .	5698.034210953291
perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour .	264.97509697080807
the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you , barney kiernan , has no sup of water to cool my courage , and my guts red roaring after lowry’s lights .	4236.0742996802555
so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and , gob , you could hear him lapping it up a mile off .	458.24570433147585
and joe asked him would he have another .	5.961647850427369
i will , says he , a chara to show there’s no ill feeling .	27.196311463648243
gob , he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking .	5.709187751902049
arsing around from one pub to another , leaving it to your own honour , with old giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators .	971.7720101184897
entertainment for man and beast .	1.9870443693478028
and says joe	1
could you make a hole in another pint ?	5.804931121608363
could a swim duck ?	1.5022923166747122
says i.	1
same again , terry , says joe .	3.9130553205612446
are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment ?	22.418208535498593
says he .	1
thank you , no , says bloom .	3.2731989018804026
as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham , don’t you see , about this insurance of poor dignam’s .	275.6632729738212
martin asked me to go to the house .	6.196100828489317
you see , he , dignam , i mean , didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy .	5095.632866897372
holy wars , says joe , laughing , that’s a good one if old shylock is landed .	53.94218794698103
so the wife comes out top dog , what ?	6.729935647948783
well , that’s a point , says bloom , for the wife’s admirers .	27.410822573794672
whose admirers ?	1
says joe .	1
the wife’s advisers , i mean , says bloom .	7.2947707660439525
then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act .	164865624.66004658
he was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court .	474.6561329701137
selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery .	14.517353725321966
true as you’re there .	1.307666158585124
o , commend me to an israelite !	3.059221266102665
royal and privileged hungarian robbery .	1.7364663126643824
so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer , a finer than poor little willy that’s dead to tell her .	3750513.9422258353
choking with bloody foolery .	1.3821102551368996
and shaking bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that .	10.785227483075499
shake hands , brother .	1.8990720029213222
you’re a rogue and i’m another .	2.6679004497046614
let me , said he , so far presume upon our acquaintance which , however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time , is founded , as i hope and believe , on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour .	279852.46218346234
but , should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness .	126.44045157278215
no , rejoined the other , i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that , though the errand be one of sorrow , this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup .	453345.6023829106
then suffer me to take your hand , said he .	11.966076975860695
the goodness of your heart , i feel sure , will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy , were i to give vent to my feelings , would deprive me even of speech .	110555.58502944843
and off with him and out trying to walk straight .	8.60872188595872
boosed at five o’clock .	1.6016665959264154
night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby , 14a. blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time , fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard , drinking porter out of teacups .	23009.32433739249
and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls , joseph manuo , and talking against the catholic religion , and he serving mass in adam and eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut , who wrote the new testament , and the old testament , and hugging and smugging .	187727.73429848076
and the two shawls killed with the laughing , picking his pockets , the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another .	11039.239957543847
how is your testament ?	1.6252701429544643
have you got an old testament ?	3.355730768306355
only paddy was passing there , i tell you what .	10.132278719885107
then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife , and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her , no less , and her violets , nice as pie , doing the little lady .	233600.59027671805
jack mooney’s sister .	1.209904864497291
and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples .	9.158628353744362
gob , jack made him toe the line .	4.550664928377249
told him if he didn’t patch up the pot , jesus , he’d kick the shite out of him .	82.10226477475368
so terry brought the three pints .	2.7276028074975693
here , says joe , doing the honours .	4.303617164515256
here , citizen .	1.3246891222002868
slan leat says he .	1.5091928431758725
fortune , joe , says i. good health , citizen .	5.499205740157581
gob , he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already .	13.361318642567625
want a small fortune to keep him in drinks .	7.448869452404853
who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty , alf ?	8.949514172973075
says joe .	1
friend of yours , says alf .	3.4969026111759587
nannan ?	1
says joe .	1
the mimber ?	1
i won’t mention any names , says alf .	4.37368262217015
i thought so , says joe .	3.4290665928043444
i saw him up at that meeting now with william field , m. p. , the cattle traders .	92.94969692833132
hairy iopas , says the citizen , that exploded volcano , the darling of all countries and the idol of his own .	123.81160375938822
so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue .	719186.0107410381
because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard .	9.428724041644386
walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier .	2338.9741598148985
mister knowall .	1
teach your grandmother how to milk ducks .	3.290069859685134
pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs o’dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her .	3788.1566634959972
couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it .	57.89481276696709
what’s your programme today ?	1.490370127946588
ay .	1
humane methods .	1
because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently .	319.4396610640292
gob , he’d have a soft hand under a hen .	11.350346220515108
ga ga gara .	1.0257401312406846
klook klook klook .	1.1369233807832135
black liz is our hen .	1.9480552811348804
she lays eggs for us .	2.078291724855117
when she lays her egg she is so glad .	5.954210952166173
gara .	1
klook klook klook .	1.1369233807832135
then comes good uncle leo .	1.8407344107961436
he puts his hand under black liz and takes her fresh egg .	12.477303438170578
ga ga ga ga gara .	2.087879929607177

you were and a bloody sight better .	4.615584601242427
is that really a fact ?	2.065075317604307
says alf .	1
yes , says bloom .	1.8240984127157507
that’s well known .	1.314886963704568
did you not know that ?	2.6949503999265696
so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that .	7919.542166456135
and of course bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad .	246.79079091139937
i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom look at , bloom .	824.8878722138113

a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian o’ciarnain’s in sraid na bretaine bheag under the auspices of sluagh na h-eireann on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture , as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland , for the development of the race .	388063.94546072
the venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions .	46.445160041191855
after an instructive discourse by the chairman , a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed , a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers .	40379.9271288131
the wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue , mr joseph m’carthy hynes , made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient gaelic sports and pastimes , practised morning and evening by finn maccool , as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages .	1027256.5374840837
l. bloom , who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses , having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close , in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house , by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis’ evergreen verses ( happily too familiar to need recalling here ) a nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself .	746915070.776403
the irish caruso-garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it .	495.45290619886765
his superb highclass vocalism , which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation , was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions .	56414.61116320351

i heard so and so made a cool hundred quid over it , says alf .	32.051684059256885
who ?	1
blazes ?	1
says joe .	1
and says bloom	1
what i meant about tennis , for example , is the agility and training the eye .	31.75366199569937
ay , blazes , says alf .	3.323190322112371
he let out that myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time .	95.10824202770581
we know him , says the citizen .	3.2651657333912643
the traitor’s son .	1.199930232367737
we know what put english gold in his pocket .	7.433502643792577
true for you , says joe .	2.5755699686243707
and bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood , asking alf	37.76092079075299
now , don’t you think , bergan ?	3.972042686153485
myler dusted the floor with him , says alf .	6.399906347886543
heenan and sayers was only a bloody fool to it .	9.133590397608778
handed him the father and mother of a beating .	6.768816793792309
see the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping .	30.823982992036935
god , he gave him one last puck in the wind , queensberry rules and all , made him puke what he never ate .	346.9258407534643
it was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns .	68.69274812720803
handicapped as he was by lack of poundage , dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft .	91.52115444467697
the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions .	7.053386632285363
the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts , the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose , and myler came on looking groggy .	5755.450581370285
the soldier got to business , leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of bennett’s jaw .	2178.5146558086294
the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a left hook , the body punch being a fine one .	89.13078731138609
the men came to handigrips .	1.9159417826655423
myler quickly became busy and got his man under , the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes , myler punishing him .	196.48357408337117
the englishman , whose right eye was nearly closed , took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck , confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in jigtime .	10117.85427792553
it was a fight to a finish and the best man for it .	13.784489100921931
the two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high .	4.74920909431996
the referee twice cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch .	48.722069574007854
after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to battling bennett’s stomach , flooring him flat .	26294.3984978164
it was a knockout clean and clever .	2.451934804700853
amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennett’s second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight .	9822.179536841406
he knows which side his bread is buttered , says alf .	8.485202240302014
i hear he’s running a concert tour now up in the north .	10.646269194562135

tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and , faith , he’ll dissolve in tears on the bench .	1079.6555203929324
ay , says alf .	1.577361980033373
reuben j was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little gumley that’s minding stones , for the corporation there near butt bridge .	1214.7196479244733
and he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry	8.896483502725498
a most scandalous thing !	1.6283723812467348
this poor hardworking man !	1.5968907238612842
how many children ?	1.4428197237125047
ten , did you say ?	2.630834592348562
yes , your worship .	1.530727437226272
and my wife has the typhoid .	3.25512843296818
and the wife with typhoid fever !	2.3540556652356326
scandalous !	1
leave the court immediately , sir .	2.6221194779918857
no , sir , i’ll make no order for payment .	7.922143416632212
how dare you , sir , come up before me and ask me to make an order !	80.38735987947705
a poor hardworking industrious man !	1.8903058210562507
i dismiss the case .	1.6927395124654854
and whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the holy and undivided trinity , the daughter of the skies , the virgin moon being then in her first quarter , it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law .	2875824.3081146143
there master courtenay , sitting in his own chamber , gave his rede and master justice andrews , sitting without a jury in the probate court , weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented jacob halliday , vintner , deceased , versus livingstone , an infant , of unsound mind , and another .	142703550.44495356
and to the solemn court of green street there came sir frederick the falconer .	20.500656676067
and he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of dublin .	26784.303360034122
and there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of iar , for every tribe one man , of the tribe of patrick and of the tribe of hugh and of the tribe of owen and of the tribe of conn and of the tribe of oscar and of the tribe of fergus and of the tribe of finn and of the tribe of dermot and of the tribe of cormac and of the tribe of kevin and of the tribe of caolte and of the tribe of ossian , there being in all twelve good men and true .	1350990180.050552
and he conjured them by him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them god and kiss the book .	513798.79306672234
and they rose in their seats , those twelve of iar , and they swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his rightwiseness .	1912.8526183284243
and straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received .	215.04560823063485
and they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor .	398.14583705415333
those are nice things , says the citizen , coming over here to ireland filling the country with bugs .	71.57102198863316
so bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with joe , telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to mr crawford .	20263.011770259298
and so joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all .	108.03875993764797
because , you see , says bloom , for an advertisement you must have repetition .	38.60342321919172
that’s the whole secret .	1.7137064266048019
rely on me , says joe .	3.435810798337174
swindling the peasants , says the citizen , and the poor of ireland .	15.016979688665968
we want no more strangers in our house .	4.338922551524067
o , i’m sure that will be all right , hynes , says bloom .	32.86151165628482
it’s just that keyes , you see .	3.568015295026637
consider that done , says joe .	3.225494079619677
very kind of you , says bloom .	4.224912419010476
the strangers , says the citizen .	2.2959451851889514
our own fault .	1.1919780444309673
we let them come in .	2.262876896847666
we brought them in .	1.7220488685971427
the adulteress and her paramour brought the saxon robbers here .	6.342893354516772
decree nisi says j. j.	1.3041882068077035
and bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing , a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel , and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when .	33279.82426367201
a dishonoured wife , says the citizen , that’s what’s the cause of all our misfortunes .	38.77353493537207
and here she is , says alf , that was giggling over the police gazette with terry on the counter , in all her warpaint .	486.7472225938254
give us a squint at her , says i.	5.019008025184659
and what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures terry borrows off of corny kelleher .	37.146926822168176

norman w. tupper , wealthy chicago contractor , finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer taylor .	24.67871202669528
belle in her bloomers misconducting herself , and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and norman w. tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer taylor .	10504.864498336065
o jakers , jenny , says joe , how short your shirt is !	13.1979788217072
there’s hair , joe , says i. get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one , what ?	103.1931323396559
so anyhow in came john wyse nolan and lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast .	135.13064134063816
well , says the citizen , what’s the latest from the scene of action ?	15.605719536834174
what did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the irish language ?	36.64814544109894
o’nolan , clad in shining armour , low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen , how that the grave elders of the most obedient city , second of the realm , had met them in the tholsel , and there , after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal , had taken solemn counsel whereby they might , if so be it might be , bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided gael .	55499745809.7284
it’s on the march , says the citizen .	4.280264361030094
to hell with the bloody brutal sassenachs and their patois .	7.497893051487669
so j. j. puts in a word , doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the nelson policy , putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation , and bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation .	3961310.401044405
their syphilisation , you mean , says the citizen .	6.71934860970422
to hell with them !	2.0431990313952433
the curse of a goodfornothing god light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores’ gets !	23.54597211392255
no music and no art and no literature worthy of the name .	14.882113759099006
any civilisation they have they stole from us .	4.367473574916758
tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts .	1.8624530086550464
the european family , says j. j....	2.844036100275076
they’re not european , says the citizen .	2.7493822020638476
i was in europe with kevin egan of paris .	4.23480152399477
you wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in europe except in a cabinet d’aisance .	53.40828139957569
and says john wyse	1.018863810605494
full many a flower is born to blush unseen .	6.217989604078571
and says lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo	8.364324098420104
conspuez les anglais !	1.1233139458511303
perfide albion !	1
he said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and , uttering his tribal slogan lamh dearg abu he drank to the undoing of his foes , a race of mighty valorous heroes , rulers of the waves , who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods .	1033695.6155445472
what’s up with you , says i to lenehan .	7.812246435297853
you look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner .	41.568210723346354
gold cup , says he .	2.764121671907589
who won , mr lenehan ?	2.340753355300341
says terry .	1
throwaway says he , at twenty to one .	4.2232730103340606
a rank outsider .	1.1947002156310034
and the rest nowhere .	1.6759925601595507
and bass’s mare ?	1.3250072884844724
says terry .	1
still running , says he .	2.5746825140226752
we’re all in a cart .	1.9304898938041215
boylan plunged two quid on my tip sceptre for himself and a lady friend .	28.964710770924473
i had half a crown myself , says terry , on zinfandel that mr flynn gave me .	69.36813534333461
lord howard de walden’s .	1.5880908503658508
twenty to one , says lenehan .	3.504753998505771
such is life in an outhouse .	3.0572577403022856
throwaway says he .	1.4188923359546493
takes the biscuit , and talking about bunions .	5.744522115889308
frailty , thy name is sceptre .	2.3999621619321587
so he went over to the biscuit tin bob doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod , the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up .	9388.230808377215
old mother hubbard went to the cupboard .	2.3449442568317864
not there , my child , says he .	7.7376861873931935
keep your pecker up , says joe .	3.4208010667287847
she’d have won the money only for the other dog .	8.938680548848039
and j. j. and the citizen arguing about law and history with bloom sticking in an odd word .	63.70316323105013
some people , says bloom , can see the mote in others’ eyes but they can’t see the beam in their own .	260.5608613466022
raimeis says the citizen .	1.379086091531907
there’s no-one as blind as the fellow that won’t see , if you know what that means .	62.41651757316609
where are our missing twenty millions of irish should be here today instead of four , our lost tribes ?	63.94185582595073
and our potteries and textiles , the finest in the whole world !	12.2954019640151
and our wool that was sold in rome in the time of juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of antrim and our limerick lace , our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by ballybough and our huguenot poplin that we have since jacquard de lyon and our woven silk and our foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the carmelite convent in new ross , nothing like it in the whole wide world .	47088187.13718319
where are the greek merchants that came through the pillars of hercules , the gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind , with gold and tyrian purple to sell in wexford at the fair of carmen ?	4174.3955052633555
read tacitus and ptolemy , even giraldus cambrensis .	3.0211918073491155
wine , peltries , connemara marble , silver from tipperary , second to none , our farfamed horses even today , the irish hobbies , with king philip of spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters .	17653.20728690107
what do the yellowjohns of anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths ?	25.196077594644724
and the beds of the barrow and shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption ?	369.5004918067821
as treeless as portugal we’ll be soon , says john wyse , or heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land .	562.92298269327
larches , firs , all the trees of the conifer family are going fast .	22.331326850734307
i was reading a report of lord castletown’s.. .	4.029760845452657
save them , says the citizen , the giant ash of galway and the chieftain elm of kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage .	296.69707175506323
save the trees of ireland for the future men of ireland on the fair hills of eire , o.	80.96491227810719
europe has its eyes on you , says lenehan .	6.326574847293736
the fashionable international world attended en masse this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier jean wyse de neaulan , grand high chief ranger of the irish national foresters , with miss fir conifer of pine valley .	1407.2452451639617

the bride who was given away by her father , the m’conifer of the glands , looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk , moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey , sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe , the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze .	2364777.9142795894
the maids of honour , miss larch conifer and miss spruce conifer , sisters of the bride , wore very becoming costumes in the same tone , a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral .	174177.83376951783
senhor enrique flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and , in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass , played a new and striking arrangement of woodman , spare that tree at the conclusion of the service .	17147.583436431218
on leaving the church of saint fiacre in horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts , beechmast , bayleaves , catkins of willow , ivytod , hollyberries , mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots .	3111.771728143365
mr and mrs wyse conifer neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the black forest .	17.604961207402866
and our eyes are on europe , says the citizen .	7.03294598367362
we had our trade with spain and the french and with the flemings before those mongrels were pupped , spanish ale in galway , the winebark on the winedark waterway .	609.9692790950792
and will again , says joe .	2.4243838175699777
and with the help of the holy mother of god we will again , says the citizen , clapping his thigh .	123.30433339552528
our harbours that are empty will be full again , queenstown , kinsale , galway , blacksod bay , ventry in the kingdom of kerry , killybegs , the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the galway lynches and the cavan o’reillys and the o’kennedys of dublin when the earl of desmond could make a treaty with the emperor charles the fifth himself .	7732098.545727147
and will again , says he , when the first irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore , none of your henry tudor’s harps , no , the oldest flag afloat , the flag of the province of desmond and thomond , three crowns on a blue field , the three sons of milesius .	1743388.090328991
and he took the last swig out of the pint .	6.5516323111756325
moya .	1
all wind and piss like a tanyard cat .	4.027692561573751
cows in connacht have long horns .	2.2109581343442457
as much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the molly maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant .	137127.2241004689
hear , hear to that , says john wyse .	6.7091298511587665
what will you have ?	1.8747503924042503

yes , sir , says terry .	3.112322653804354
small whisky and bottle of allsop .	2.48647273114828
right , sir .	1.086473248992795
hanging over the bloody paper with alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public .	51.44979245790137
picture of a butting match , trying to crack their bloody skulls , one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate .	1366.9614713929961
and another one black beast burned in omaha , ga .	5.103990199751557
a lot of deadwood dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him .	385.68228881303895
gob , they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job .	120.41564802449265
but what about the fighting navy , says ned , that keeps our foes at bay ?	46.77757118396185
i’ll tell you what about it , says the citizen .	8.397341081788632
hell upon earth it is .	2.4134634721222312
read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at portsmouth .	31.285624918428283
a fellow writes that calls himself disgusted one .	3.193100685341191
so he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out , howling for his ma , and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun .	749545.1534084743
a rump and dozen , says the citizen , was what that old ruffian sir john beresford called it but the modern god’s englishman calls it caning on the breech .	813.8711978588532
and says john wyse	1.018863810605494
’tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance .	8.275344743447292
then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder .	5064.685227702563
that’s your glorious british navy , says the citizen , that bosses the earth .	15.733137736725022
the fellows that never will be slaves , with the only hereditary chamber on the face of god’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons .	2526.354376397813
that’s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs .	8.048904128989225
on which the sun never rises , says joe .	8.143399277587132
and the tragedy of it is , says the citizen , they believe it .	24.99270388481243
the unfortunate yahoos believe it .	1.8131245333943398
they believe in rod , the scourger almighty , creator of hell upon earth , and in jacky tar , the son of a gun , who was conceived of unholy boast , born of the fighting navy , suffered under rump and dozen , was scarified , flayed and curried , yelled like bloody hell , the third day he arose again from the bed , steered into haven , sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid .	2585878590.0186644
but , says bloom , isn’t discipline the same everywhere .	8.25729414372249
i mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force ?	28.08257079308743
didn’t i tell you ?	1.510688647268998
as true as i’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living .	186.53645093844375
we’ll put force against force , says the citizen .	4.646251204700021
we have our greater ireland beyond the sea .	4.8979544167783216
they were driven out of house and home in the black 47 .	9.272328769909844
their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as redskins in america .	4820.898213970084
even the grand turk sent us his piastres .	3.569335702018636
but the sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro .	557.9215239449222
ay , they drove out the peasants in hordes .	6.408312180931376
twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships .	4.53407570637749
but those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage .	33.49219943095431
and they will come again and with a vengeance , no cravens , the sons of granuaile , the champions of kathleen ni houlihan .	142.58839464298367
perfectly true , says bloom .	2.5643704930229703
but my point was.. .	1.3994848409598308
we are a long time waiting for that day , citizen , says ned .	30.92544666197995
since the poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at killala .	75.98895978698606
ay , says john wyse .	1.645267860185011
we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us against the williamites and they betrayed us .	22.02412495081545
remember limerick and the broken treatystone .	2.584100215600519
we gave our best blood to france and spain , the wild geese .	12.714089060016157
fontenoy , eh ?	1.0671936222256428
and sarsfield and o’donnell , duke of tetuan in spain , and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria teresa .	76.21860739425694

firebrands of europe and they always were .	4.071725397480816
conspuez les français says lenehan , nobbling his beer .	4.3194407175096305
and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians , says joe , haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george the elector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead ?	5621.655267133939
jesus , i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her , blind drunk in her royal palace every night of god , old vic , with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about ehren on the rhine and come where the boose is cheaper .	998824368.2425344

edward guelph-wettin !	1
and what do you think , says joe , of the holy boys , the priests and bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode .	22205.7326793148
the earl of dublin , no less .	4.36911332300654
they ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself , says little alf .	45.0247030513641
and says j. j.	1.0579104358407538
considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision .	2.40458141232891

bloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about .	213.3002295363205
persecution , says he , all the history of the world is full of it .	29.50929530977899
perpetuating national hatred among nations .	1.7576605774293748
but do you know what a nation means ?	5.549678463071054
says john wyse .	1.3499586533159416
yes , says bloom .	1.8240984127157507
what is it ?	1.2691409564690643
says john wyse .	1.3499586533159416
a nation ?	1
says bloom .	1
a nation is the same people living in the same place .	10.855118104201244
by god , then , says ned , laughing , if that’s so i’m a nation for i’m living in the same place for the past five years .	1344.885957972821
so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he , trying to muck out of it	50.00982287777762
or also living in different places .	2.789661175563721
that covers my case , says joe .	3.686560295596049
what is your nation if i may ask ?	5.000404252525912
says the citizen .	1.3426106192930234

ireland .	1
the citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and , gob , he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner .	672.3776825834807
after you with the push , joe , says he , taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry .	68.83745768664308
here you are , citizen , says joe .	4.034563873939348
take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words .	23.041804497758047
the muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient irish facecloth attributed to solomon of droma and manus tomaltach og macdonogh , authors of the book of ballymote , was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration .	821.9194506089896
no need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces , the acme of art , wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol , a bogoak sceptre , a north american puma ( a far nobler king of beasts than the british article , be it said in passing ), a kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill .	29431666.411545906
the scenes depicted on the emunctory field , showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones , are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the barmecides .	144553.10670085144
glendalough , the lovely lakes of killarney , the ruins of clonmacnois , cong abbey , glen inagh and the twelve pins , ireland’s eye , the green hills of tallaght , croagh patrick , the brewery of messrs arthur guinness , son and company ( limited ), lough neagh’s banks , the vale of ovoca , isolde’s tower , the mapas obelisk , sir patrick dun’s hospital , cape clear , the glen of aherlow , lynch’s castle , the scotch house , rathdown union workhouse at loughlinstown , tullamore jail , castleconnel rapids , kilballymacshonakill , the cross at monasterboice , jury’s hotel , s. patrick’s purgatory , the salmon leap , maynooth college refectory , curley’s hole , the three birthplaces of the first duke of wellington , the rock of cashel , the bog of allen , the henry street warehouse , fingal’s cave all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time .	7.293618473099301e+17
show us over the drink , says i. which is which ?	12.907114806700605
that’s mine , says joe , as the devil said to the dead policeman .	28.458488649320866
and i belong to a race too , says bloom , that is hated and persecuted .	34.80492807709176
also now .	1
this very moment .	1.4138276237025427
this very instant .	1.2146668297406589
gob , he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar .	27.61945462232501

plundered .	1
insulted .	1

taking what belongs to us by right .	2.8696398965177314
at this very moment , says he , putting up his fist , sold by auction in morocco like slaves or cattle .	169.88803878798916
are you talking about the new jerusalem ?	3.735685252309735
says the citizen .	1.3426106192930234
i’m talking about injustice , says bloom .	3.5904267289483642
right , says john wyse .	1.9301954177099039
stand up to it then with force like men .	6.7427969100051905
that’s an almanac picture for you .	2.3387918860439973
mark for a softnosed bullet .	1.8977454065472996
old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun .	10.175172816624356
gob , he’d adorn a sweepingbrush , so he would , if he only had a nurse’s apron on him .	76.80482205808048
and then he collapses all of a sudden , twisting around all the opposite , as limp as a wet rag .	125.2557797442541
but it’s no use , says he .	4.105822658000944
force , hatred , history , all that .	5.434161550015061
that’s not life for men and women , insult and hatred .	10.656740970606519
and everybody knows that it’s the very opposite of that that is really life .	26.973629534208698
what ?	1
says alf .	1
love , says bloom .	1.8494428907467892

a new apostle to the gentiles , says the citizen .	5.782867839683776
universal love .	1

we know those canters , says he , preaching and picking your pocket .	9.975249079752292
what about sanctimonious cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of drogheda to the sword with the bible text god is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon ?	2064.147177205817
the bible !	1
did you read that skit in the united irishman today about that zulu chief that’s visiting england ?	36.822234136855364
what’s that ?	1
says joe .	1
so the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out	28.896380515970094
a delegation of the chief cotton magnates of manchester was presented yesterday to his majesty the alaki of abeakuta by gold stick in waiting , lord walkup of walkup on eggs , to tender to his majesty the heartfelt thanks of british traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions .	146398.1327237749
the delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate , in the course of a happy speech , freely translated by the british chaplain , the reverend ananias praisegod barebones , tendered his best thanks to massa walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between abeakuta and the british empire , stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible , the volume of the word of god and the secret of england’s greatness , graciously presented to him by the white chief woman , the great squaw victoria , with a personal dedication from the august hand of the royal donor .	129119328300.52429
the alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast black and white from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty kakachakachak , surnamed forty warts , after which he visited the chief factory of cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book , subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance , in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks , amid hilarious applause from the girl hands .	14879240.063718267
widow woman , says ned .	2.5933169081520075
i wouldn’t doubt her .	1.5069384526919793
wonder did he put that bible to the same use as i would .	25.901549297037604
same only more so , says lenehan .	3.541778732355168
and thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly .	5.5738840151856985
is that by griffith ?	1.6876604226272138
says john wyse .	1.3499586533159416
no , says the citizen .	1.8088089514851617
it’s not signed shanganagh .	1.3643789036969394
it’s only initialled p.	1.1837538202466973
and a very good initial too , says joe .	7.480434004824047
that’s how it’s worked , says the citizen .	3.462957327916073
trade follows the flag .	1.6951367099318484
well , says j. j. , if they’re any worse than those belgians in the congo free state they must be bad .	98.94685770124424
did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is ?	26.49402813067532
casement , says the citizen .	1.85683025324592
he’s an irishman .	1.3636084048194526
yes , that’s the man , says j. j. raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them .	2352.617776310869
i know where he’s gone , says lenehan , cracking his fingers .	15.235863599840878
who ?	1
says i.	1
bloom , says he .	1.6909763787341652
the courthouse is a blind .	2.3124775042192494
he had a few bob on throwaway and he’s gone to gather in the shekels .	24.420415209170212
is it that whiteeyed kaffir ?	1.8264655875099107
says the citizen , that never backed a horse in anger in his life ?	28.461808411238028
that’s where he’s gone , says lenehan .	3.530664778220364
i met bantam lyons going to back that horse only i put him off it and he told me bloom gave him the tip .	573.6062045667
bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on .	19.303410318015466
he’s the only man in dublin has it .	5.591603561508101
a dark horse .	1.36202790582385
he’s a bloody dark horse himself , says joe .	7.6737053004862785
mind , joe , says i. show us the entrance out .	7.096001604398053
there you are , says terry .	3.8031106853236425
goodbye ireland i’m going to gort .	2.0093081416490115
so i just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob ( hundred shillings to five ) while i was letting off my throwaway twenty to ) letting off my load gob says i to myself i knew he was uneasy in his ( two pints off of joe and one in slattery’s off ) in his mind to get off the mark to ( hundred shillings is five quid ) and when they were in the ( dark horse ) pisser burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick ( gob , must have done about a gallon ) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she’s better or she’s ( ow !	29050494724358.57
) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or ( jesus , full up i was ) trading without a licence ( ow !	784.3666079408024
) ireland my nation says he ( hoik !	4.3292560763724355
phthook !	1
) never be up to those bloody ( there’s the last of it ) jerusalem ( ah !	72.52749911518362
) cuckoos .	1
so anyhow when i got back they were at it dingdong , john wyse saying it was bloom gave the ideas for sinn fein to griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering , packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling irish industries .	1365875.0415285446
robbing peter to pay paul .	2.0861161340698673
gob , that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show .	47.31494348849422
give us a bloody chance .	1.946715360819517
god save ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout .	7.649657862735853
mr bloom with his argol bargol .	2.3536627592075137
and his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds , old methusalem bloom , the robbing bagman , that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds .	4184.491201261234
loans by post on easy terms .	2.536620629328484
any amount of money advanced on note of hand .	6.3294412602815
distance no object .	1.3198369286656426
no security .	1
gob , he’s like lanty machale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with every one .	43.47748372919509
well , it’s a fact , says john wyse .	5.098561056409044
and there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it , martin cunningham .	22.106121296569796
sure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power with him and a fellow named crofter or crofton , pensioner out of the collector general’s , an orangeman blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense .	311841.69505593565
our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys .	6.2069328938835095
ho , varlet !	1.1233139458511303
cried he , who by his mien seemed the leader of the party .	21.02947000416719
saucy knave !	1
to us !	1
so saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice .	10.801273871142058
mine host came forth at the summons , girding him with his tabard .	15.34713191166687
give you good den , my masters , said he with an obsequious bow .	22.381424031452198
bestir thyself , sirrah !	1.6047022516419913
cried he who had knocked .	2.372905369412037
look to our steeds .	1.6414308612010513
and for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it .	14.545855565113744
lackaday , good masters , said the host , my poor house has but a bare larder .	122.16351767373787
i know not what to offer your lordships .	4.439167929009759
how now , fellow ?	1.896018275123562
cried the second of the party , a man of pleasant countenance , so servest thou the king’s messengers , master taptun ?	248.72510029556025
an instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage .	2.339568806818533
cry you mercy , gentlemen , he said humbly .	4.508706407148483
an you be the king’s messengers ( god shield his majesty !	12.800559212265531
) you shall not want for aught .	4.2147773829802375
the king’s friends ( god bless his majesty !	4.765931879030562
) shall not go afasting in my house i warrant me .	9.006176895364284
then about !	1
cried the traveller who had not spoken , a lusty trencherman by his aspect .	20.0611833149138
hast aught to give us ?	2.440363072008126
mine host bowed again as he made answer	3.8333167823716616
what say you , good masters , to a squab pigeon pasty , some collops of venison , a saddle of veal , widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon , a boar’s head with pistachios , a bason of jolly custard , a medlar tansy and a flagon of old rhenish ?	64655.958404706354
gadzooks !	1
cried the last speaker .	1.6851548057967742
that likes me well .	1.4268118273976556
pistachios !	1
aha !	1
cried he of the pleasant countenance .	2.86350608404244
a poor house and a bare larder , quotha !	6.9212383983583035
’tis a merry rogue .	1.6302742962705998

where is he ?	1.4442422842939662
says lenehan .	1
defrauding widows and orphans .	1.458133381418089
isn’t that a fact , says john wyse , what i was telling the citizen about bloom and the sinn fein ?	162.33263949901857
that’s so , says martin .	2.464531688150464
or so they allege .	1.5916239285390241

says alf .	1
i , says joe .	1.7586345019905896
i’m the alligator .	1.1150300427930042
and after all , says john wyse , why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow ?	100.31919979653418
why not ?	1
says j. j. , when he’s quite sure which country it is .	15.58424822894677
is he a jew or a gentile or a holy roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he ?	165.40742914970198
says ned .	1
or who is he ?	1.9735462680061577

he’s a perverted jew , says martin , from a place in hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the hungarian system .	446.7490867216605
we know that in the castle .	3.405621274611302

the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace .	14.262281200621892
far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand , on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay , on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and , last but not least , on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man , mary , star of the sea .	20810692979.058075
the three girl friends were seated on the rocks , enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly .	395.4739897549587
many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine , cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey , two little curlyheaded boys , dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name h. m. s. belleisle printed on both .	27477225.10055999
for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins , scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them .	2919.974981538071
they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets , building castles as children do , or playing with their big coloured ball , happy as the day was long .	2592.9017585026468
and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight .	92.43937401938825
he was but eleven months and nine days old and , though still a tiny toddler , was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words .	507.631525877477
cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin .	77.91775646015836
now , baby , cissy caffrey said .	3.5155201417948487
say out big , big .	2.476768113641886
i want a drink of water .	3.4103136157476275
and baby prattled after her	1.3888369987513896
a jink a jink a jawbo .	2.4534876145498914
cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children , so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on .	899859.3794126617
what a persuasive power that girl had !	3.2584087720295956
but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold , a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib .	177.67286284830095
none of your spoilt beauties , flora macflimsy sort , was cissy caffrey .	10.158143068529466
a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life , always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips , a girl lovable in the extreme .	2865.7978353390736
and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother .	10.849870498608821
but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky .	28.1081048524926
boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule .	35.6282453539556
the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had .	12012.090110127934
but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and , true to the maxim that every little irishman’s house is his castle , he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and ( alas to relate !	87207.51421282768
) the coveted castle too .	1.6361845292467958
needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends .	42.048316432374584
come here , tommy , his sister called imperatively .	6.615356856775605
at once !	1
and you , jacky , for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand .	32.36190728059089
wait till i catch you for that .	3.34787514419992
his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins .	120.00117983015167
and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure .	9.23680568941212
his little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit .	17532.945014670386
still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him , her eyes dancing in admonition .	197997.6735633293
nasty bold jacky !	1.2276165158000019
she cried .	1
she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly	8.705387048577318
what’s your name ?	1.4416947017231565
butter and cream ?	1.333983803061684
tell us who is your sweetheart , spoke edy boardman .	9.625888347242872
is cissy your sweetheart ?	1.5559342326175467
nao , tearful tommy said .	1.7213652855383288
is edy boardman your sweetheart ?	2.184435743767786
cissy queried .	1
nao , tommy said .	1.7561367203239304
i know , edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes .	33.46738558696531
i know who is tommy’s sweetheart .	2.2292903813523277
gerty is tommy’s sweetheart .	1.1499306584729385
nao , tommy said on the verge of tears .	6.021137977524665
cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes .	8981.673676867085
but who was gerty ?	1.9590833368596876
gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions , lost in thought , gazing far away into the distance was , in very truth , as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see .	22098.596119466867
she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though , as folks often said , she was more a giltrap than a macdowell .	299.62810369711536
her figure was slight and graceful , inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling .	112553.12199798273
the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupid’s bow , greekly perfect .	162.2295118710592
her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either .	16294.158001108577
bertha supple told that once to edy boardman , a deliberate lie , when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty ( the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals ) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again .	88830152.44236839
no .	1
honour where honour is due .	2.0172091887084984
there was an innate refinement , a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep .	80.02814363369171
had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her .	33059575.693700872
mayhap it was this , the love that might have been , that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look , tense with suppressed meaning , that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes , a charm few could resist .	72852.07503599754
why have women such eyes of witchery ?	2.9770332415659495
gerty’s were of the bluest irish blue , set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows .	38.804845353666416
time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive .	6.371714034216426
it was madame vera verity , directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette , who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes , so becoming in leaders of fashion , and she had never regretted it .	47684.35742584508
then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose ?	286.266584227382
that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one .	10.388010195771624
but gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair .	5.967486377711207
it was dark brown with a natural wave in it .	7.816139221639867
she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too , thursday for wealth .	2885.579281594371
and just now at edy’s words as a telltale flush , delicate as the faintest rosebloom , crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god’s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal .	29160.34320550019
for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes .	9.456796343794043
she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue .	17.12017272560452
inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent .	14.584195001198742
the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning .	1741.7392656665409
she knew right well , no-one better , what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel .	582.397902445728
as per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window .	2581.6049520898478
only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w. e. wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university .	3149032.4368746835
little recked he perhaps for what she felt , that dull aching void in her heart sometimes , piercing to the core .	135.3959407769463
yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time .	31.09257971709001
they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph .	509.8351236016518
but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked , every inch a gentleman , the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden .	10854792846693.24
gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out .	1136.215066664727
a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes ( because it was expected in the lady’s pictorial that electric blue would be worn ) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket ( in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit ) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection .	48462464.0251381
she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone .	799.6032480267036
all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery’s summer sales , the very it , slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice , seven fingers two and a penny .	43721.196476044446
she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then , smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her !	3566.0521046265694
and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew .	965.5377313487003
her shoes were the newest thing in footwear ( edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell , a five , and never would ash , oak or elm ) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep .	168570.2173687124
her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops .	1411.1560299350117
as for undies they were gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen ( though gerty would never see seventeen again ) can find it in his heart to blame her ?	10551.841003986867
she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery , three garments and nighties extra , and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons , rosepink , pale blue , mauve and peagreen , and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things .	22878639.75278745
she was wearing the blue for luck , hoping against hope , her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a friday .	19329588714208.47
and yet and yet !	1.8675771203001275
that strained look on her face !	2.919990658243093
a gnawing sorrow is there all the time .	5.408022956584999
her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where , giving way to tears , she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror .	1451265.9551206243
you are lovely , gerty , it said .	5.783915724150124
the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful .	13.35158702826184
gerty macdowell yearns in vain .	1.9163273235915592
yes , she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t. c. d. ( because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie ) and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be .	8053679.492570915
he was too young to understand .	2.7987422743102024
he would not believe in love , a woman’s birthright .	10.791489280146314
the night of the party long ago in stoer’s ( he was still in short trousers ) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips .	7955.207654726659
he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss ( the first !	64.66479791214222
) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments .	233.31534983658437
impetuous fellow !	1
strength of character had never been reggy wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men .	307.9076479656263
but waiting , always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over .	78.4392805431095
no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal , perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey , and who would understand , take her in his sheltering arms , strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss .	231383694.60022846
it would be like heaven .	1.9690423377666686
for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve .	6.704254067917954
with all the heart of her she longs to be his only , his affianced bride for riches for poor , in sickness in health , till death us two part , from this to this day forward .	12385.154776827407
and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be .	2499.892670623364
then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face , bertha supple too , and edy , little spitfire , because she would be twentytwo in november .	2404.779742643926
she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess .	379.4487539439433
her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire , dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction , then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltrap’s lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses .	95236960329674.61
he would be tall with broad shoulders ( she had always admired tall men for a husband ) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon ( three wonderful weeks !	24189.719229775554
) and then , when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house , every morning they would both have brekky , simple but perfectly served , for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes .	11557195.025572833
edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight .	61505.11739955503
but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground , if you please .	937214.3610270289
the temper of him !	1.7471285592095611
o , he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies .	43.36618652293528
edy told him no , no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him .	714.587274399327
you’re not my sister , naughty tommy said .	4.9303639901303224
it’s my ball .	1.2128758132719861
but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up , look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career , having won the day .	52824.62316614668
anything for a quiet life , laughed ciss .	5.3125580101886865
and she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor , here’s his two horses , here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in , chinchopper , chinchopper , chinchopper chin .	13774.961771790293
but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him .	107.45684632503428
i’d like to give him something , she said , so i would , where i won’t say .	149.4530295623275
on the beeoteetom , laughed cissy merrily .	2.7829159472447333
gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say , flushing a deep rosy red , and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said .	320056.66338957445
but not a pin cared ciss .	2.7166194560066255
let him !	1
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose .	36.164719898423215
give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at him .	52.65644544252171
madcap ciss with her golliwog curls .	2.36969154597112
you had to laugh at her sometimes .	3.566148634722147
for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white .	8019883.849985521
that was just like cissycums .	2.1827233734567963
o , and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road , smoking a cigarette .	6746.363268710873
there was none to come up to her for fun .	10.071695366622517
but she was sincerity itself , one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made , not one of your twofaced things , too sweet to be wholesome .	839.1307301961732
and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ .	113.03179388844308
it was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner , the reverend john hughes s. j. , rosary , sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament .	374.5396183344947
they were there gathered together without distinction of social class ( and a most edifying spectacle it was to see ) in that simple fane beside the waves , after the storms of this weary world , kneeling before the feet of the immaculate , reciting the litany of our lady of loreto , beseeching her to intercede for them , the old familiar words , holy mary , holy virgin of virgins .	40227787.57632042
how sad to poor gerty’s ears !	2.807071779569851
had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink , by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearson’s weekly , she might now be rolling in her carriage , second to none .	9205.181374542692
over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket , thinking .	107805.57954687135
but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days .	54.83488436736364
nay , she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father , a prey to the fumes of intoxication , forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness , deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low .	263209645.34300685
and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful , virgin most merciful .	35.54766472080415
and gerty , rapt in thought , scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk .	84913.99410582871
you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face ( it was a palpable case of doctor fell ) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose .	8737237.19806714
poor father !	1
with all his faults she loved him still when he sang tell me , mary , how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried , god have mercy on him , from a stroke .	27821189.53708587
her mother’s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken .	3374.964985799405
no-one would have thought the end was so near .	8.345113694781286
now he was laid to rest .	3.076215348331718
and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino , artistic , standard designs , fit for a palace , gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home .	329693553.84031576
a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house , a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold .	1036.4091156996976
and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about , taking snuff .	45876.97569781751
everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways .	11.19707053364124
it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac , the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window .	128663362.47051442
you could see there was a story behind it .	5.72797228316141
the colours were done something lovely .	2.317384436985879
she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat .	209.55248307298598
she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant .	1553746.0262504963
the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks .	21775.54790083058
needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball .	2381.416632200331
our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please .	308.17593755265733
the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock .	12176.700512400233
the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed .	601520.7548397215
if you fail try again , edy boardman said .	5.766660538707874
gerty smiled assent and bit her lip .	2.7117736552017893
a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle .	1214038.9995962635
pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking .	61.83167525629562
she felt the warm flush , a danger signal always with gerty macdowell , surging and flaming into her cheeks .	109.66442853883285
till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight , wan and strangely drawn , seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen .	323070.11129501835
through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin , spiritual vessel , pray for us , honourable vessel , pray for us , vessel of singular devotion , pray for us , mystical rose .	140521.2501878628
and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered , their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary , the most pious virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her .	320833800.96668684
the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers .	46.520516738618625
cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee , clapping baby hands in air .	35.489587714601534
peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah !	684.9263904275746
and , my word , didn’t the little chap enjoy that !	12.284611155021661
and then she told him to say papa .	7.204051100220181
say papa , baby .	1.797699242401538
say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa .	4.478088871687605
and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health , a perfect little bunch of love , and he would certainly turn out to be something great , they said .	331092.5464268605
haja ja ja haja .	1.4139189669422916
cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out , holy saint denis , that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him .	300698.3151862021
of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it	26.93547080361174
habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa .	1.1150300427930042
and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks .	6.929955167818173
it was all no use soothering him with no , nono , baby , no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss , always readywitted , gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased .	166666.26139154483
gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves , no hour to be out , and the little brats of twins .	3225.054393652494
she gazed out towards the distant sea .	3.1903854746075244
it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out , the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft .	53367373.55835582
and while she gazed her heart went pitapat .	4.04323499793908
yes , it was her he was looking at , and there was meaning in his look .	86.172891748298
his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through , read her very soul .	90.34280335980088
wonderful eyes they were , superbly expressive , but could you trust them ?	18.587311903143462
people were so queer .	1.6803965118602748
she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner , the image of the photo she had of martin harvey , the matinee idol , only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting .	1026403601.1186357
he was in deep mourning , she could see that , and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face .	316.89726026573686
she would have given worlds to know what it was .	11.176951496596494
he was looking up so intently , so still , and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down .	31367.938249327144
she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away .	459.71379921189987
here was that of which she had so often dreamed .	12.47751714264474
it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else .	512.1244128717709
the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him , her dreamhusband , because she knew on the instant it was him .	213.65731048412553
if he had suffered , more sinned against than sinning , or even , even , if he had been himself a sinner , a wicked man , she cared not .	2010.0782128677752
even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her .	40.4889312142058
there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm .	3.26775710925003
she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known , those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all , to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her , make him forget the memory of the past .	915301.765849059
then mayhap he would embrace her gently , like a real man , crushing her soft body to him , and love her , his ownest girlie , for herself alone .	1687.6020981345926
refuge of sinners .	1.1150300427930042
comfortress of the afflicted .	1.819043471753018
ora pro nobis .	1.4384157230273509
well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart .	24304.43730425855
gerty could picture the whole scene in the church , the stained glass windows lighted up , the candles , the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin’s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o’hanlon at the altar , carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down .	763714.9818972517
he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic .	193445.01562912686
he told her that time when she told him about that in confession , crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see , not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws , he said , in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god , he said , and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word .	78994926719.1926
he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place .	49305809252.023094
the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it .	338.88556845381993
little monkeys common as ditchwater .	1.7045510250378435
someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places , the both of them .	823.6574694666033
and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned .	616.6594194198861
jacky !	1
tommy !	1
not they !	1
what a great notion they had !	3.0013820270595044
so cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out .	25.258443133052268
she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him , tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it .	48459576.988257095
she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible .	2862153222.6818223
it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble .	5838.5568595830255
tableau !	1
that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness .	36.52288335998335
queen of angels , queen of patriarchs , queen of prophets , of all saints , they prayed , queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o’hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o’hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the tantumer gosa cramen tum .	8.859972819236483e+17
three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrow’s of george’s street on the tuesday , no the monday before easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at , transparent , and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form ( the cheek of her !	1269062.7282065926
) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself .	32.23741503215891
cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature .	20187277.100979704
gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier , a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders a radiant little vision , in sooth , almost maddening in its sweetness .	15304.316715579223
you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that .	168.160912802652
she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve .	113.8539186346225
she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes .	3850.9907834558444
he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey .	7.323405339751625
her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose .	8179.726024520826
edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty , half smiling , with her specs like an old maid , pretending to nurse the baby .	981.6423016240242
irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers .	1373.8088606865635
and she said to gerty	2.0208127975633183
a penny for your thoughts .	2.540222274825861
what ?	1
replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth .	10.521883881119335
i was only wondering was it late .	3.6454907253431097
because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late .	3889.2710986481247
and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy , as glib as you like , said it was half past kissing time , time to kiss again .	3861.067746364963
but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early .	22.332350625067132
wait , said cissy , i’ll run ask my uncle peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum .	86.2405684108279
so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket , getting nervous , and beginning to play with his watchchain , looking up at the church .	23358.927072383674
passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself .	24.95320326441004
one moment he had been there , fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze , and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman , selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure .	4525.271005503452
cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch , listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set .	14648415.562230594
his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones .	340.53529844930773
cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order .	115.10231657690447
then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon o’hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time .	1050991606.4322118
it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets .	62380.92254771152
she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon .	242853.39685927582
his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour , literally worshipping at her shrine .	52.43643723779143
if ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face .	228.53100770715017
it is for you , gertrude macdowell , and you know it .	15.838276575398174
edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over .	2.757556682765293e+16
gerty winced sharply .	1.1475626685961053
a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable .	15.532500993314184
it hurt o yes , it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was .	989.4701463277424
gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat , so slim , so flawless , so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of .	5882.623157824196
she had loved him better than he knew .	6.147141949791922
lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears .	4258.66184461668
their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see .	600.3937675202621
o , responded gerty , quick as lightning , laughing , and the proud head flashed up .	43.72890757433033
i can throw my cap at who i like because it’s leap year .	13.412564545999642
her words rang out crystalclear , more musical than the cooing of the ringdove , but they cut the silence icily .	99.16688885621097
there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with .	179.95445080524877
as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces .	162118.78972664406
and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot .	422.7429122859617
miss puny little edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it , the little kinnatt , because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof , apart , in another sphere , that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it .	42989420576.001724
edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior .	15570.05146244881
and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky , laughing up out of his gleeful eyes , and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby , without as much as by your leave , sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib .	56860100.17514379
o my !	1
puddeny pie !	1
protested ciss .	1
he has his bib destroyed .	2.067256687022558
the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights .	35.834520984982056
gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon o’hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands .	61617053102.948616
how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight , the last glimpse of erin , the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk , hither , thither , with a tiny lost cry .	83733.46522404885
and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins , author of mabel vaughan and other tales .	4345435985.120684
for gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of .	5.750903364861098
she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which , though it did not err on the side of luxury , was scrupulously neat and clean .	297322.9013670386
it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove , the tortoiseshell combs , her child of mary badge , the whiterose scent , the eyebrowleine , her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely’s of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs .	68570429577.84848
art thou real , my ideal ?	2.6301910510929742
it was called by louis j walsh , magherafelt , and after there was something about twilight , wilt thou ever ?	99.76679297925931
and ofttimes the beauty of poetry , so sad in its transient loveliness , had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her , one by one , and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it .	20232937.06443213
but it must end , she felt .	4.546302032225166
if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her .	59.06432657087913
love laughs at locksmiths .	1.383304243190979
she would make the great sacrifice .	3.1608223999343084
her every effort would be to share his thoughts .	5.332125762161342
dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness .	52.605426754520025
there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse , cruel only to be kind .	1078336.7114325883
but even if what then ?	1.864629224271145
would it make a very great difference ?	3.8938136560168584
from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled .	5.639895343264222
she loathed that sort of person , the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour , degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station .	28897.746328062643
no , no not that .	1.9261217649956193
they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess .	687.7989201187667
perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall .	40.72328739569419
she thought she understood .	1.7021420076215033
she would try to understand him because men were so different .	10.728011019165773
the old love was waiting , waiting with little white hands stretched out , with blue appealing eyes .	61.00396952231482
heart of mine !	1.3956751362329112
she would follow , her dream of love , the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all , the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide .	47191.79074264514
nothing else mattered .	1.1751800344309515
come what might she would be wild , untrammelled , free .	10.457510569545983
canon o’hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn’t she coming but jacky caffrey called out	603253.1401894488
o , look , cissy !	2.533876418320852
and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church , blue and then green and purple .	763.1651459784488
it’s fireworks , cissy caffrey said .	2.3815978410944636
and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church , helterskelter , edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running .	39316.75135624127
come on , gerty , cissy called .	3.4975288502336426
it’s the bazaar fireworks .	1.7590679927006254
but gerty was adamant .	1.5268893307680063
she had no intention of being at their beck and call .	9.403053118611517
if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was .	121.31615373155127
the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling .	8.88410678404717
she looked at him a moment , meeting his glance , and a light broke in upon her .	93.42310013959813
whitehot passion was in that face , passion silent as the grave , and it had made her his .	146.916244180622
at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death , steadfast , a sterling man , a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips .	15304.668649354318
his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her .	12.643921363999308
she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that , supply soft and delicately rounded , and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart , his hoarse breathing , because she knew too about the passion of men like that , hotblooded , because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed .	7501930797686305.0
but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips .	14152.893786146064
besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too , my dear , and winny rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did .	358581656.2976386
and jacky caffrey shouted to look , there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look , look , there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air , a soft thing , to and fro , dark .	180590758.7190672
and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees , up , up , and , in the tense hush , they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it , high , high , almost out of sight , and her face was suffused with a divine , an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too , nainsook knickers , the fabric that caresses the skin , better than those other pettiwidth , the green , four and eleven , on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking , looking .	4.995069805239673e+24
she would fain have cried to him chokingly , held out her snowy slender arms to him to come , to feel his lips laid on her white brow , the cry of a young girl’s love , a little strangled cry , wrung from her , that cry that has rung through the ages .	1469633.4584248224
and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o !	10.052433244963524
then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o !	20.990075617571346
and everyone cried o !	1.5200102384883627
o !	1
in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah !	87.38753157970207
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden , o so lovely , o , soft , sweet , soft !	167.60844185654634
then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent .	11.347100579318319
ah !	1
she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly , a pathetic little glance of piteous protest , of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl .	972.2016977383001
he was leaning back against the rock behind .	4.477902206112692
leopold bloom ( for it is he ) stands silent , with bowed head before those young guileless eyes .	83.00712618383956
what a brute he had been !	2.60162638220012
at it again ?	1.387948661478404
a fair unsullied soul had called to him and , wretch that he was , how had he answered ?	79.53403929046321
an utter cad he had been !	2.574028152755582
he of all men !	1.9598170141360007
but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes , for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered .	1317.2915425657407
should a girl tell ?	1.738188360729574
no , a thousand times no .	2.967188509244692
that was their secret , only theirs , alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell .	10405.782578072623
cissy caffrey whistled , imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried	198.1160695320668
gerty !	1
gerty !	1
we’re going .	1
come on .	1
we can see from farther up .	3.1912299433554856
gerty had an idea , one of love’s little ruses .	8.362400258669165
she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back .	730.1684142519466
wonder if he’s too far to .	3.1486127682017604
she rose .	1
was it goodbye ?	1.2271337994788896
no .	1
she had to go but they would meet again , there , and she would dream of that till then , tomorrow , of her dream of yester eve .	2919.6684723676035
she drew herself up to her full height .	4.770255797307751
their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart , full of a strange shining , hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face .	1564.8567015606804
she half smiled at him wanly , a sweet forgiving smile , a smile that verged on tears , and then they parted .	218.19210548562089
slowly , without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy , to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey , to little baby boardman .	811.1382813849121
it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed .	52.42347370354448
she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because because gerty macdowell was.. .	177.08440772661118

or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped .	40.08234171861231
yet if i went the whole hog , say i want to , something like that .	67.27849367944486
because i did .	1.3874766763019186
she too .	1
offend her .	1
then make it up .	1.9980055619886474
pretend to want something awfully , then cry off for her sake .	10.682781152519276
flatters them .	1
she must have been thinking of someone else all the time .	11.682426935365372
what harm ?	1
must since she came to the use of reason , he , he and he .	39.94783050189797
first kiss does the trick .	1.9047606645071369
the propitious moment .	1.1827329108695441
something inside them goes pop .	1.9965019605948613
mushy like , tell by their eye , on the sly .	8.420270104676543

after glencree dinner that was when we drove home .	7.521203921277996

i knew she could whistle .	2.445755181899563
mouth made for that .	1.870382625227751
like molly .	1
why that highclass whore in jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose .	15.164960758137518
would you mind , please , telling me the right time ?	16.85249876378689

caressing the little boy too .	2.05716054410667
onlookers see most of the game .	3.439672120463636
of course they understand birds , animals , babies .	5.867349746172303
in their line .	1.087507306261439
didn’t look back when she was going down the strand .	10.937500853797271
wouldn’t give that satisfaction .	1.4446737909369611
those girls , those girls , those lovely seaside girls .	3.959293700241534
fine eyes she had , clear .	3.1366277762355734
it’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil .	34.27715401248944
did she know what i ?	2.689251436261316
course .	1
like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump .	4.318084643558949
women never meet one like that wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of venus with all his belongings on show .	109.63211767736611

where do they get that ?	2.5606669195763527
typist going up roger greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings .	25.61345431407441
handed down from father to , mother to daughter , i mean .	20.339641441360087
bred in the bone .	1.8615376336311646
milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing .	15.428785549312348
best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror .	29.05089531989161
and when i sent her for molly’s paisley shawl to prescott’s by the way that ad i must , carrying home the change in her stocking !	488.59946444740984
clever little minx .	1.1150300427930042
i never told her .	1.6984126403807094
neat way she carries parcels too .	2.5481393620226176
attract men , small thing like that .	3.87357301095059
holding up her hand , shaking it , to let the blood flow back when it was red .	106.54343905408437
who did you learn that from ?	3.323833421985739
nobody .	1
something the nurse taught me .	2.0002440270389723
o , don’t they know !	2.7499089790106424
three years old she was in front of molly’s dressingtable , just before we left lombard street west .	42.86135388617592

lord , i am wet .	2.003518698561509
devil you are .	1.382141871848544
swell of her calf .	1.6712719909539133
transparent stockings , stretched to breaking point .	3.658420209860227
not like that frump today .	1.666386127527379

white .	1
wow !	1
beef to the heel .	2.083681235971891
a monkey puzzle rocket burst , spluttering in darting crackles .	4.527643668115122
zrads and zrads , zrads , zrads .	3.2697573119555425
and cissy and tommy and jacky ran out to see and edy after with the pushcar and then gerty beyond the curve of the rocks .	894.0436273320216

off colour after kiernan’s , dignam’s .	2.3649793506887202
for this relief much thanks .	1.3099147743293031
in hamlet that is .	1.695190490987488
lord !	1
it was all things combined .	2.1701604017069402
excitement .	1
when she leaned back , felt an ache at the butt of my tongue .	22.559517363904956
your head it simply swirls .	1.5153945046471018
he’s right .	1
might have made a worse fool of myself however .	5.515405706297218
instead of talking about nothing .	2.2432620253841336
then i will tell you all .	2.562267595837338
still it was a kind of language between us .	4.106663145445604
it couldn’t be ?	1.2393106369398306
no , gerty they called her .	3.226428647531471
might be false name however like my name and the address dolphin’s barn a blind .	27.665159275936265
her maiden name was jemina brown and she lived with her mother in irishtown .	24.224195268499223
place made me think of that i suppose .	6.588250124220168
all tarred with the same brush .	2.96554787758397
wiping pens in their stockings .	2.043914413784451
but the ball rolled down to her as if it understood .	13.659398225626918
every bullet has its billet .	1.8529990247737405
course i never could throw anything straight at school .	5.511485067645498
crooked as a ram’s horn .	1.810009137376447
sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah .	6564.02753755594
no soft job .	1.1820231559225065
saves them .	1
keeps them out of harm’s way .	2.7120091822964056
nature .	1
washing child , washing corpse .	2.1936267358216393
dignam .	1
children’s hands always round them .	1.7492397594418332
cocoanut skulls , monkeys , not even closed at first , sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds .	64.59072566311269
oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck .	10.631990700498664
fill it up with wind .	2.3854218934359888
mrs beaufoy , purefoy .	1.779952840148866
must call to the hospital .	2.7185595828591227
wonder is nurse callan there still .	2.585599179160222
she used to look over some nights when molly was in the coffee palace .	17.161799582068006
that young doctor o’hare i noticed her brushing his coat .	6.023062536454845
and mrs breen and mrs dignam once like that too , marriageable .	14.349821122817906
worst of all at night mrs duggan told me in the city arms .	21.90119868099253
husband rolling in drunk , stink of pub off him like a polecat .	10.776594396949559
have that in your nose in the dark , whiff of stale boose .	19.937174555522724
then ask in the morning was i drunk last night ?	7.632920259611151
bad policy however to fault the husband .	3.115086341788315
chickens come home to roost .	2.1474343472804254
they stick by one another like glue .	3.5089525924332943
maybe the women’s fault also .	1.975338361437233
that’s where molly can knock spots off them .	3.9442647293363504
it’s the blood of the south .	3.1954887816739634
moorish .	1
also the form , the figure .	3.548492433151587
hands felt for the opulent .	2.0442911516602607
just compare for instance those others .	2.605993447989816
wife locked up at home , skeleton in the cupboard .	7.1584798534141605
allow me to introduce my .	2.0938190579378206
then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript , wouldn’t know what to call her .	36.59611312199979
always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife .	6.086092052776255
still there’s destiny in it , falling in love .	6.1704477891485485
have their own secrets between them .	2.770249531973694
chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand .	32.95488042704796
then little chits of girls , height of a shilling in coppers , with little hubbies .	33.41709863706708
as god made them he matched them .	3.570322731970452
sometimes children turn out well enough .	2.890669143493504
twice nought makes one .	1.5135146236769526
or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride .	4.889463420511862
marry in may and repent in december .	3.1263716830610453
this wet is very unpleasant .	1.9374605947281942
stuck .	1
well the foreskin is not back .	2.2322239469230167
better detach .	1
ow !	1
other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket .	8.53300190904267
long and the short of it .	3.0525927143350198
big he and little she .	2.404907642758748
very strange about my watch .	2.202539201294866
wristwatches are always going wrong .	2.0739071449389743
wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he .	60.627341995589
yes , i suppose , at once .	4.6930193160599805
cat’s away , the mice will play .	3.6203680599823045
i remember looking in pill lane .	2.38601202836695
also that now is magnetism .	2.0151597406686252
back of everything magnetism .	1.4375768569758964
earth for instance pulling this and being pulled .	4.660447632992354
that causes movement .	1.1980727454556126
and time , well that’s the time the movement takes .	10.271448728171139
then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit .	13.950426211116755
because it’s all arranged .	1.671728975712642
magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun , the stars .	16.57687367955608
little piece of steel iron .	2.2443053168096134
when you hold out the fork .	3.101233526724658
come .	1
come .	1
tip .	1
woman and man that is .	2.4678005549860327
fork and steel .	1.182094559006915
molly , he .	1.412038920783995
dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and , like a sneeze coming , legs , look , look and if you have any guts in you .	205167.16557516737
tip .	1
have to let fly .	1.986248396570913
wonder how is she feeling in that region .	5.741943099468196
shame all put on before third person .	3.1510874822141632
more put out about a hole in her stocking .	8.74185078229465
molly , her underjaw stuck out , head back , about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show .	152.797192009369
and when the painters were in lombard street west .	3.313576737619773
fine voice that fellow had .	2.7384207977275317
how giuglini began .	1.215228431041798
smell that i did .	1.9512912661058792
like flowers .	1
it was too .	1.4432993301029904
violets .	1
came from the turpentine probably in the paint .	3.2342684803111412
make their own use of everything .	3.0682394935949415
same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear .	18.0110997530715
but lots of them can’t kick the beam , i think .	11.066537740300513
keep that thing up for hours .	3.0921955965794172
kind of a general all round over me and half down my back .	17.502558281672986
wait .	1
hm .	1
hm .	1
yes .	1
that’s her perfume .	1.3065593561024442
why she waved her hand .	2.5161810903511004
i leave you this to think of me when i’m far away on the pillow .	30.71265440034853
what is it ?	1.2691409564690643
heliotrope ?	1
no .	1
hyacinth ?	1
hm .	1
roses , i think .	1.9562863069413385
she’d like scent of that kind .	3.050465735824278
sweet and cheap soon sour .	2.045605517196869
why molly likes opoponax .	1.3697402352067505
suits her , with a little jessamine mixed .	4.240088481789654
her high notes and her low notes .	3.3864193840374845
at the dance night she met him , dance of the hours .	11.469998790162274
heat brought it out .	1.9055836128576664
she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before .	38.20119087521047
good conductor , is it ?	2.063646867449414
or bad ?	1
light too .	1
suppose there’s some connection .	1.3355714535451684
for instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark .	10.108464649266056
mysterious thing too .	1.1797422431430973
why did i smell it only now ?	4.20075016303064
took its time in coming like herself , slow but sure .	9.577133326786132
suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across .	7.676705296195266
yes , it is .	2.044369358522446
because those spice islands , cinghalese this morning , smell them leagues off .	9.68094690005024
tell you what it is .	2.5490422519663793
it’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin , fine like what do you call it gossamer , and they’re always spinning it out of them , fine as anything , like rainbow colours without knowing it .	50744.77167628702
clings to everything she takes off .	2.774287900822187
vamp of her stockings .	1.8108975670510365
warm shoe .	1
stays .	1
drawers little kick , taking them off .	3.407597215967474
byby till next time .	1.473472864868789
also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed .	12.635968703717163
know her smell in a thousand .	3.085123052458595
bathwater too .	1
reminds me of strawberries and cream .	3.2270477816869367
wonder where it is really .	2.551201099548062
there or the armpits or under the neck .	4.646580313331183
because you get it out of all holes and corners .	7.656220371455836
hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something .	4.829812956354696
muskrat .	1
bag under their tails .	1.8130348158366707
one grain pour off odour for years .	3.131423150447303
dogs at each other behind .	2.2893397050491413
good evening .	1
evening .	1
how do you sniff ?	1.3857844011480915
hm .	1
hm .	1
very well , thank you .	1.999898072165158
animals go by that .	1.9147304823541658

therefore , everyman , look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came .	505643.5575388703
the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed .	2745.0203212243823
the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be .	10129.707371743476
she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth .	188.97978318578532
then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house .	298.73061910082663
the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid .	294716.02349197736
nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless .	1.8395653313749671
and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat .	387.7500210152341
and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon .	27.779341450842757
and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice .	113207364.87210687
and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there .	278.63809531322846
and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile .	73.06470596863336
also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility .	463.65322259221915
but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle .	892.8247890591354
and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery .	400.9249024439907
and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment .	1877.9153098647403
and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously .	3912.4280798612244
and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles .	1955.5841938928984
and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer .	37.091197541683115
and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so .	5517.5133069763615
and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress .	324.14152732225654
and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain .	48795.16333623746
and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead .	1116.3270115639282
and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each .	152.09239820075513
and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile .	204430.73980649599
and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile .	60.49093526298001
thanked be almighty god .	1.3691022686557002
this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child , a gentle dame , whose time hied fast .	12208.314092278535
sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel , said he , that it be not come or now .	6447.99360538545
meseems it dureth overlong .	1.253225240973506
and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently .	151697.43344787747
but , said he , or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long .	1596.3288215925102
and the franklin that had drunken said , expecting each moment to be her next .	28.434324413953174
also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and , now drink , said he , fully delectably , and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness .	576836.9524741464
and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup .	222773.2898339592
woman’s woe with wonder pondering .	1.8917658799598032
now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might .	94.17066380694376
there was a sort of scholars along either side the board , that is to wit , dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable’s with other his fellows lynch and madden , scholars of medicine , and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa , one crotthers , and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested ( and of all them , reserved young stephen , he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead ) and beside the meek sir leopold .	703692842946.1663
but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow .	785.4215006930931
and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner .	66180.58770863593
ruth red him , love led on with will to wander , loth to leave .	32.9940220267657
for they were right witty scholars .	2.5724551380246257
and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness , young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die ( for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case ) .	129205199.0952636
and they said farther she should live because in the beginning , they said , the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die .	112796.17814786134
and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy .	15362.913010999566
a redress god grant .	1.5936291317707802
this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay , by our virgin mother , the wife should live and the babe to die .	560.7111166108621
in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack .	8445.31638642188
then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved .	323491.2907469492
to whom young stephen had these words following murmur , sirs , is eke oft among lay folk .	41.49961244927368
both babe and parent now glorify their maker , the one in limbo gloom , the other in purgefire .	52.83490230484467
but , gramercy , what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise , which is the sin against the holy ghost , very god , lord and giver of life ?	2084.1417047864084
for , sirs , he said , our lust is brief .	7.537992369088225
we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we .	29.730621136610033
then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends .	6.8649710927167575
but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead .	46501.32322745303
whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn , the other all this while , pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him , witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do .	5698713.082034278
thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever .	62452.8264698829
then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom , of law of canons , of lilith , patron of abortions , of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or , as virgilius saith , by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with , effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides .	1641352761.5517614
he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal , even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded .	10874160.002816407
all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life .	180.73446714222743
a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and , laying hand to jaw , he said dissembling , as his wont was , that as it was informed him , who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman , and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions .	304041200.4519773
that is truth , pardy , said dixon , and , or i err , a pregnant word .	57.74174611761153
which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons .	47515.92908189276
but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny .	2799216.734787784
and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool , the flower of the flock , lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled ( for it was then about the midst of the winter ) and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage ( for all accounted him of real parts ) so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores .	226605748198887.78
about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who , praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff , he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray .	4016882.6237025443
now drink we , quod he , of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment .	466.39093502863517
leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone .	11.861974265087914
be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay .	42.684114861671304
see ye here .	1.183183685677762
and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had , he said , for a song which he writ .	1316.7120331681017
they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore .	20.748694008199834
his words were then these as followeth know all men , he said , time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions .	42.4994627644306
what means this ?	1.2364994628917882
desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time .	68.14602905276219
mark me now .	1.2562769049517197
in woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away .	490.0493898529984
this is the postcreation .	1.3152744414716098
omnis caro ad te veniet .	1.2518356169340172
no question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our agenbuyer , healer and herd , our mighty mother and mother most venerable and bernardus saith aptly that she hath an omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem that is to wit , an almightiness of petition because she is the second eve and she won us , saith augustine too , whereas that other , our grandam , which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all , seed , breed and generation , for a penny pippin .	3665755154.923953
but here is the matter now .	3.1846732210315443
or she knew him , that second i say , and was but creature of her creature , vergine madre , figlia di tuo figlio or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with peter piscator who lives in the house that jack built and with joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages , parceque m. léo taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichue position c’était le sacré pigeon , ventre de dieu !	231620026.8441311
entweder transubstantiality oder consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality .	4.347882119121502
and all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word .	11.675404289247295
a pregnancy without joy , he said , a birth without pangs , a body without blemish , a belly without bigness .	117.06608372776036
let the lewd with faith and fervour worship .	3.462623769142453
with will will we withstand , withsay .	2.5792287111701704
hereupon punch costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch staboo stabella about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in almany which he did straightways now attack the first three months she was not well , staboo when here nurse quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard .	13521953848.70265
it was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking , in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage , nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently punch costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him , a murrain seize the dolt , what a devil he would be at , thou chuff , thou puny , thou got in peasestraw , thou losel , thou chitterling , thou spawn of a rebel , thou dykedropt , thou abortion thou , to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of god ape , the good sir leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet , margerain gentle , advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred .	3.5969785164388564e+16
in horne’s house rest should reign .	2.491278680866873
to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles , goodly grinning , asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb , chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days .	327816.7278788883
master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how , as he heard hereof counted , he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too , waxing merry and toasting to his fathership .	127668.88452940223
but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin .	123.21324010181215
thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses , as the priests use in madagascar island , she to be in guise of white and saffron , her groom in white and grain , with burning of nard and tapers , on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided .	41195048.72492545
he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets master john fletcher and master francis beaumont that is in their maid’s tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers to bed , to bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals .	287421.36385191727
an exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion .	97.94016300420206
well met they were , said master dixon , joyed , but , harkee , young sir , better were they named beau mount and lecher for , by my troth , of such a mingling much might come .	13749.078750725908
young stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it .	43797.0566308786
greater love than this , he said , no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend .	170.69811924283823
go thou and do likewise .	2.2664615018326137

and all the people shall say , amen .	3.6227131677292106
remember , erin , thy generations and thy days of old , how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like jeshurum .	47391.35366020921
therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me , thy lord , to be the slave of servants .	162.36398396872676
return , return , clan milly forget me not , o milesian .	12.26465700999699
why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the roman and to the indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously ?	7426.482994342686
look forth now , my people , upon the land of behest , even from horeb and from nebo and from pisgah and from the horns of hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money .	3212.1315282331598
but thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever .	67.98919207917568
and thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth .	346.1779193101628
this tenebrosity of the interior , he proceeded to say , hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the orient from on high which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous .	13631.216247159704

and as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals , that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being .	145907.72036463014

and as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to tophet or to edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness .	123307.8240372256
thereto punch costello roared out mainly etienne chanson but he loudly bid them , lo , wisdom hath built herself a house , this vast majestic longstablished vault , the crystal palace of the creator , all in applepie order , a penny for him who finds the pea .	101277.95317016673
behold the mansion reared by dedal jack see the malt stored in many a refluent sack , in the proud cirque of jackjohn’s bivouac .	87.3660139004319
a black crack of noise in the street here , alack , bawled back .	14.24115686656863
loud on left thor thundered in anger awful the hammerhurler .	4.70256108273345
came now the storm that hist his heart .	4.537395739720553
and master lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry .	102.99144924199767
and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm .	572571.8443794721
then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour .	14400.561068943702
but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead .	216.12906823794702
but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in horne’s hall .	23.63612242847802
he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden , being godly certain whiles , knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom , at the braggart’s side , spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear , advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard , the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead , look you , having taken place , and all of the order of a natural phenomenon .	338477011160.5549
but was young boasthard’s fear vanquished by calmer’s words ?	3.7461308891020293
no , for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away .	137.23907301389195
and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other ?	25.671109721165816
he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either .	18.736732827517155
but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal ?	247.4587485797776

heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or , what calmer said , a hubbub of phenomenon ?	206.67497228645695
heard ?	1
why , he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding ( which he had not done ) .	345.59202338015155
for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show .	4203.412331784528
and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away ?	25.72511080176415
by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law .	1195.8978193078603
then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe-on-me , that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it ?	420802.4873394135
yes , pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name , she said , is bird-in-the-hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as , ho , you pretty man , turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place , and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two-in-the-bush or , by some learned , carnal concupiscence .	1414629185081.0505
this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird-in-the-hand ( which was within all foul plagues , monsters and a wicked devil ) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her .	1000054.3854342194
for regarding believe-on-me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for , first , two-in-the-bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them , pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and , second , for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and , third , that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild .	2245456164882.6357
so were they all in their blind fancy , mr cavil and mr sometimes godly , mr ape swillale , mr false franklin , mr dainty dixon , young boasthard and mr cautious calmer .	3039.608700960091
wherein , o wretched company , were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth .	580650.2384133388

with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him ( for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it ) but on stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk .	44539797.87293898
he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women , horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat .	379.2330436791898
to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps , ostlers , bookies , paul’s men , runners , flatcaps , waistcoateers , ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip .	6949745.058238165
he took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue , some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides .	3948996.1239136807

there’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset .	312672.41013223986
mort aux vaches says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too .	1076.810176543623
from a child this frank had been a donought that his father , a headborough , who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes , matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes .	24332499.05371474
one time he would be a playactor , then a sutler or a welsher , then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main , then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk , kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge .	3039544.7151614064
he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him .	12244.29313301228
what , says mr leopold with his hands across , that was earnest to know the drift of it , will they slaughter all ?	325.24035931892996

i can scarce believe ’tis so bad , says he .	8.24372718113736
and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers , greasy hoggets and wether wool , having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe , a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low’s yard in prussia street .	84111.81652876009

mr stephen , a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality , that was sending over doctor rinderpest , the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy , with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns .	624326.0047339181
come , come , says mr vincent , plain dealing .	8.241454889173967
he’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s irish , says he .	128.89247534604826
irish by name and irish by nature , says mr stephen , and he sent the ale purling about , an irish bull in an english chinashop .	566.9898331281382
i conceive you , says mr dixon .	4.429765122122009
it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas , the bravest cattlebreeder of them all , with an emerald ring in his nose .	1725.727938753459
true for you , says mr vincent cross the table , and a bullseye into the bargain , says he , and a plumper and a portlier bull , says he , never shit on shamrock .	3662.716632634133
he had horns galore , a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island , leaving doughballs and rollingpins , followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains .	17035.06409305781
what for that , says mr dixon , but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself .	6271.413725176198
so be off now , says he , and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing , and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly .	5419.416088713361
but the slap and the blessing stood him friend , says mr vincent , for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid , wife , abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland .	5054074075.8947315
another then put in his word and they dressed him , says he , in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content .	227832604.64922792
by this time the father of the faithful ( for so they called him ) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture .	727.4580603134317
to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him .	125722.6642084272
ay , says another , and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself ( for that was the only colour to his mind ) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice , saying by the lord harry , green is the grass that grows on the ground .	248332583.99541017
and , says mr dixon , if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry’s orders .	1876108.4424526768
there was bad blood between them at first , says mr vincent , and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i’ll meddle in his matters , says he .	119093.61667776306
i’ll make that animal smell hell , says he , with the help of that good pizzle my father left me .	114.42101346384487
but one evening , says mr dixon , when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace ( he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks ) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans , bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show .	90893867565.84819
after that , says mr vincent , the lord harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name .	11168.957870147393
then , with the water running off him , he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy , the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat .	120071791717.7123
in short , he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt .	159.4390782264272
they were , says mr stephen , and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward , as the ungrate women were all of one mind , made a wherry raft , loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard , set all masts erect , manned the yards , sprang their luff , heaved to , spread three sheets in the wind , put her head between wind and water , weighed anchor , ported her helm , ran up the jolly roger , gave three times three , let the bullgine run , pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america .	2296529954358.625
which was the occasion , says mr vincent , of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty	63.678336969121744

our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered , a young gentleman , his name alec bannon , who had late come to town , it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars .	5465676.699579484
mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on .	5473.677409434525
whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan .	1355.4576515164833
fertiliser and incubator .	1.1150300427930042
lambay island .	1
his project , as he went on to expound , was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed .	128291.57518558556
well , let us hear of it , good my friend , said mr dixon .	51.51669507684159
i make no doubt it smacks of wenching .	3.773599833646407
come , be seated , both .	2.911795459100044
’tis as cheap sitting as standing .	2.317653320471388
mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and , expatiating upon his design , told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility , both the inhibitory and the prohibitory , whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired .	7732368.320174114
it grieved him plaguily , he said , to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures , a prey to the vilest bonzes , who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness , sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress , this , he assured them , made his heart weep .	3175773624.7408924
to curb this inconvenient ( which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat ), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter , he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder , lord talbot de malahide , a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party .	978811.1955802708
he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural .	1120086.4086868223
money was no object , he said , nor would he take a penny for his pains .	59.37416999743201
the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion , if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions , would find in him their man .	1916.174142298371
for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there , the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose , both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies .	97739.18676750986
after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it .	898.013414410852
they both , it seems , had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water , as might be observed by mr mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald .	21122.404177783916
his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary’s excepted to it , asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle .	5725.006646047806
mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which , as it dwelt upon his memory , seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi , o quirites , ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach , the buck and doe of the forest glade , the farmyard drake and duck .	531825632.0799587
valuing himself not a little upon his elegance , being indeed a proper man of person , this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced .	92103.98686885695
the young gentleman , his friend , overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him , could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour .	1655.5152707548596
mr mulligan , now perceiving the table , asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and , seeing the stranger , he made him a civil bow and said , pray , sir , was you in need of any professional assistance we could give ?	181408.84790239058
who , upon his offer , thanked him very heartily , though preserving his proper distance , and replied that he was come there about a lady , now an inmate of horne’s house , that was in an interesting condition , poor body , from woman’s woe ( and here he fetched a deep sigh ) to know if her happiness had yet taken place .	18192033.38563032
mr dixon , to turn the table , took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence , upon which he rallied him , betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due , as with the noted physician , mr austin meldon , to a wolf in the stomach .	797984.2183073038
for answer mr mulligan , in a gale of laughter at his smalls , smote himself bravely below the diaphragm , exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan ( the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop there’s a belly that never bore a bastard .	132743.86744689126
this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight .	226.2701317472623
the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber .	43.64471346087436
here the listener who was none other than the scotch student , a little fume of a fellow , blond as tow , congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and , interrupting the narrative at a salient point , having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head ( a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture ) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it .	6226597582242.043
mais bien sûr noble stranger , said he cheerily , et mille compliments .	9.182023890396287
that you may and very opportunely .	2.90382939282225
there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity .	6.624526046148289
but , gracious heaven , was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well , my god , i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things .	9159896.260485765
with these words he approached the goblet to his lips , took a complacent draught of the cordial , slicked his hair and , opening his bosom , out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband , that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein .	579997.3980463659
gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness , ah , monsieur , he said , had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap ( a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily ) in such an artless disorder , of so melting a tenderness , ’pon my conscience , even you , monsieur , had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever .	24183196222.07434
i declare , i was never so touched in all my life .	16.22028451312388
god , i thank thee , as the author of my days !	15.422987996011894
thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours .	20.941298211340364
a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and , having replaced the locket in his bosom , he wiped his eye and sighed again .	624.0654749465223
beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures , how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond , the simple swain and the polished coxcomb , the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years .	137271.93874330787
but indeed , sir , i wander from the point .	8.084325286657965
how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys .	4.410173039211005

he exclaimed in anguish .	1.4957116332179923
would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along !	26.070501011701495
i could weep to think of it .	3.936148599965093
then , though it had poured seven showers , we were neither of us a penny the worse .	80.41588046647668
but beshrew me , he cried , clapping hand to his forehead , tomorrow will be a new day and , thousand thunders , i know of a marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz , from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting .	1912085.2886141324
tut , tut !	1.183170611214717
cries le fécondateur , tripping in , my friend monsieur moore , that most accomplished traveller ( i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town ), is my authority that in cape horn , ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any , even the stoutest cloak .	2627723.4389598025
a drenching of that violence , he tells me , sans blague has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world .	258.2598580826519
pooh !	1
a livre !	1
cries monsieur lynch .	1.2237783995005214
the clumsy things are dear at a sou .	3.982071578433407
one umbrella , were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom , is worth ten such stopgaps .	46.38883520628806
no woman of any wit would wear one .	4.416828276045859
my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for , as she reminded me ( blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies ), dame nature , by the divine blessing , has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb , in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties , is the fittest , nay , the only garment .	115013422157.5479
the first , said she ( and here my pretty philosopher , as i handed her to her tilbury , to fix my attention , gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear ), the first is a bath.. .	43408.65365725311
but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge .	271.9718657827853
amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and , while all were conjecturing what might be the cause , miss callan entered and , having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon , retired with a profound bow to the company .	320473.80483161047
the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry .	22800.539206464036
strike me silly , said costello , a low fellow who was fuddled .	18.01831291665088
a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh !	2.33293843933096
i’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you .	2.8304367340972822
what , you dog ?	1.7520482139592874
have you a way with them ?	3.0859104596015663
gad’s bud , immensely so , said mr lynch .	6.070194349668424
the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice .	17.513741093815277
demme , does not doctor o’gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin .	12.258508538059766
as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months .	242.7615721150096
lawksamercy , doctor , cried the young blood in the primrose vest , feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body , how you do tease a body !	1880.8950645801494
drat the man !	1.403897756912647
bless me , i’m all of a wibbly wobbly .	5.320691293516769
why , you’re as bad as dear little father cantekissem , that you are !	26.580846065501376
may this pot of four half choke me , cried costello , if she aint in the family way .	104.9949608262713
i knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her .	47.69228922283192
the young surgeon , however , rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward .	1355.5819880290273
merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy .	4612.700624570573
i want patience , said he , with those who , without wit to enliven or learning to instruct , revile an ennobling profession which , saving the reverence due to the deity , is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth .	18624.403124251494
i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which , so far from being a byword , should be a glorious incentive in the human breast .	39543.60936706523
i cannot away with them .	2.300077028411482
what ?	1
malign such an one , the amiable miss callan , who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours ?	223.2249658140451
and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay ?	25.598403559537076
perish the thought !	1.3806849495879894
i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne .	2990.4953665329426
having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door .	55.92909252372222
a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado , a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation ( for he swore a round hand ) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath .	19203767.01953532
stap my vitals , said he , them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart .	1456515.816425346
to revert to mr bloom who , after his first entry , had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity .	34253.112848816025
the young sparks , it is true , were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf .	640624.3563619824
but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity , born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world , which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to , so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin .	497758907.3892774
it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and , being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast , he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and , by intercepting them with the readiest precaution , foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at , rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable .	258179633.94193178
to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy ( a habit of mind which he never did hold with ) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding while for such that , having lost all forbearance , can lose no more , there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat .	69610585.4885331
not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which , caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe , is ever ( as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it ) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions .	12405585.830481147
to conclude , while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was , however , it must be owned , not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being .	1655098.39230596
accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour , saying that , to express his notion of the thing , his opinion ( who ought not perchance to express one ) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers .	59064329.330957726
the dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron .	473.4868953644045
i must acquaint you , said mr crotthers , clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis , old glory allelujurum was round again today , an elderly man with dundrearies , preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina , my life , as he calls her .	736856.3856646226
i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon .	21.204552610244153
’slife , i’ll be round with you .	4.278630225107248
i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her .	48.181416368417075
all fell to praising of it , each after his own fashion , though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap , a clerk in orders , a linkboy ( virtuous ) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household .	890294.3669111943
singular , communed the guest with himself , the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them , that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity , that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest .	2603489.520655376
but , he further added , it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together .	1835.1015863645355
but with what fitness , let it be asked of the noble lord , his patron , has this alien , whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights , constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity ?	16453.044257967336
where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled ?	6.186785702848138
during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents ?	85241.3811830561
has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received ?	6.60797098364263
or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is , if report belie him not , his own and his only enjoyer ?	5095.874473090533
far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady , the daughter of a gallant major , or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there ( as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done ) then be it so .	1008029.2190717073
unhappy woman , she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate .	806.1461599695604
he says this , a censor of morals , a very pelican in his piety , who did not scruple , oblivious of the ties of nature , to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society !	14038.758931347138
nay , had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel , it had gone with her as hard as with hagar , the egyptian !	406.5333314215275
in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic .	1905.9962630632056
it ill becomes him to preach that gospel .	3.92348405165845
has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare ?	24.470615059806466
a habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life .	10.612886352206734
if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him .	715.1203050508444
his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce .	12.583340223166958
the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which , when rooted in its native orient , throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but , transplanted to a clime more temperate , its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant , acid and inoperative .	56906121.75703821
the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence , who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born .	16183.85619943468
when he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council , silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates , chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier , broke out at once into a strife of tongues .	99779638.93447627
in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge , to mollify , to refrain .	57.646894525033915
the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent .	100.31832415515858
every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers , the caesarean section , posthumity with respect to the father and , that rarer form , with respect to the mother , the fratricidal case known as the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused , the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets , miscarriages and infanticides , simulated or dissimulated , the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion , the agnathia of certain chinless chinamen ( cited by mr candidate mulligan ) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that ( as he said ) one ear could hear what the other spoke , the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep , the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein , the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid ( as exemplified in the actual case ) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix , artificial insemination by means of syringes , involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause , the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape , that distressing manner of delivery called by the brandenburghers sturzgeburt the recorded instances of multiseminal , twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents in a word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations .	1.2917139393970678e+25
the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest , by her movement , the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning , ardently and ineffectually entertained , to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation .	521880104.59688586
the abnormalities of harelip , breastmole , supernumerary digits , negro’s inkle , strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded ( the case of madame grissel steevens was not forgotten ) or doghaired infants occasionally born .	16469.95760377814
the hypothesis of a plasmic memory , advanced by the caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for , envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human .	7851.286720033878
an outlandish delegate sustained against both these views , with such heat as almost carried conviction , the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes , his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses .	2379351.3145247567
the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived .	6.9705222102385145
it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect , postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man .	20695.460640032907
contemporaneously , a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other , the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus .	61663.817236166724
hitherto silent , whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice , he delivered briefly and , as some thought , perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has joined .	269970.4690076947
but malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror .	4.684350816170237
he conjured up the scene before them .	4.022641830886306
the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared.. .	10.180583524215427
haines !	1
which of us did not feel his flesh creep !	7.055918283883275
he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand , in the other a phial marked poison .	66.48405312637443
surprise , horror , loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin .	42.884215108475985
i anticipated some such reception , he began with an eldritch laugh , for which , it seems , history is to blame .	266.7523420202489
yes , it is true .	2.7363766185464535
i am the murderer of samuel childs .	2.385822780528282
and how i am punished !	2.304970834430769
the inferno has no terrors for me .	3.370215808662271
this is the appearance is on me .	3.3693140489116096
tare and ages , what way would i be resting at all , he muttered thickly , and i tramping dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus ?	21696.016201191596
my hell , and ireland’s , is in this life .	12.033033158072312
it is what i tried to obliterate my crime .	6.46295178921482
distractions , rookshooting , the erse language ( he recited some ), laudanum ( he raised the phial to his lips ), camping out .	155.50992654286716
in vain !	1
his spectre stalks me .	1.451103617918787
dope is my only hope.. .	1.936946659550837
ah !	1
destruction !	1
the black panther !	1.4428682084480204
with a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back .	9.013216733315021
an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven .	124.53106435572708
he was gone .	1.1180674901989542
tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host .	6.029578198932965
the seer raised his hand to heaven , murmuring the vendetta of mananaun !	18.330531600249763
the sage repeated lex talionis .	1.481058341905136
the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done .	7.990331998608011
malachias , overcome by emotion , ceased .	3.0830743063226866
the mystery was unveiled .	1.415744832255195
haines was the third brother .	2.788977688162605
his real name was childs .	2.402577807421956
the black panther was himself the ghost of his own father .	14.20591911990268
he drank drugs to obliterate .	1.9481936221122131
for this relief much thanks .	1.3099147743293031
the lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited .	3.745150376421028
no soul will live there .	2.0102839431859176
the spider pitches her web in the solitude .	2.990396720731557
the nocturnal rat peers from his hole .	3.1215004345962165
a curse is on it .	2.353530349884021
it is haunted .	1.1150300427930042
murderer’s ground .	1
what is the age of the soul of man ?	8.192354643411196
as she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach , to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast , so too is her age changeable as her mood .	11254.57491250737
no longer is leopold , as he sits there , ruminating , chewing the cud of reminiscence , that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds .	987.6253995003262
a score of years are blown away .	3.642119151686375
he is young leopold .	1.5089995647738987
there , as in a retrospective arrangement , a mirror within a mirror ( hey , presto !	66.27313433915741
), he beholdeth himself .	1.349404369062556
that young figure of then is seen , precociously manly , walking on a nipping morning from the old house in clanbrassil street to the high school , his booksatchel on him bandolierwise , and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf , a mother’s thought .	77304.25298264634
or it is the same figure , a year or so gone over , in his first hard hat ( ah , that was a day !	929.8247580429393
), already on the road , a fullfledged traveller for the family firm , equipped with an orderbook , a scented handkerchief ( not for show only ), his case of bright trinketware ( alas !	4251.36577071618
a thing now of the past !	2.905854677171001
) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin , shyly acknowledging ( but the heart ?	758.6732813968235
tell me !	1
) his studied baisemoins .	1.3585555932208897
the scent , the smile , but , more than these , the dark eyes and oleaginous address , brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm , seated with jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle ( a meal of noodles , you may be sure , is aheating ), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the europe of a month before .	51222101.295162804
but hey , presto , the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes , shrivels , dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist .	379.8273401917373
now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons .	17.92036598896971
who can say ?	1.3333552856963031
the wise father knows his own child .	3.34131293347497
he thinks of a drizzling night in hatch street , hard by the bonded stores there , the first .	73.10215862473119
together ( she is a poor waif , a child of shame , yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny ), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university .	108524.05411575458
bridie !	1
bridie kelly !	1
he will never forget the name , ever remember the night first night , the bridenight .	65.2546498969043
they are entwined in nethermost darkness , the willer with the willed , and in an instant fiat !	40.85398771706723
light shall flood the world .	2.0020706837593076
did heart leap to heart ?	2.0854705550432366
nay , fair reader .	1.4728266873409224
in a breath ’twas done but hold !	2.8972093989269
back !	1
it must not be !	1.7128075572368069
in terror the poor girl flees away through the murk .	7.344429546475075
she is the bride of darkness , a daughter of night .	14.401059288788685
she dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day .	5.011329254303107
no , leopold .	1.4443596868738768
name and memory solace thee not .	2.1160848912468952
that youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee and in vain .	17.97095886070875
no son of thy loins is by thee .	5.01531225534565
there is none now to be for leopold , what leopold was for rudolph .	26.18982116579701
the voices blend and fuse in clouded silence silence that is the infinite of space and swiftly , silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived .	1024.614842157523
a region where grey twilight ever descends , never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields , shedding her dusk , scattering a perennial dew of stars .	95.94308254533951
she follows her mother with ungainly steps , a mare leading her fillyfoal .	13.436148488569772
twilight phantoms are they , yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure , slim shapely haunches , a supple tendonous neck , the meek apprehensive skull .	225.41213656210724
they fade , sad phantoms all is gone .	4.356463944773993
agendath is a waste land , a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa .	18.39316735326375
netaim , the golden , is no more .	5.935248451629069
and on the highway of the clouds they come , muttering thunder of rebellion , the ghosts of beasts .	67.7600035376778
huuh !	1
hark !	1
huuh !	1
parallax stalks behind and goads them , the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions .	14.239234064105725
elk and yak , the bulls of bashan and of babylon , mammoth and mastodon , they come trooping to the sunken sea , lacus mortis .	192.0633287310161
ominous revengeful zodiacal host !	1.3801029487685692
they moan , passing upon the clouds , horned and capricorned , the trumpeted with the tusked , the lionmaned , the giantantlered , snouter and crawler , rodent , ruminant and pachyderm , all their moving moaning multitude , murderers of the sun .	9896.14831635323
onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink , unslaked and with horrible gulpings , the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood .	111.25132581653241
and the equine portent grows again , magnified in the deserted heavens , nay to heaven’s own magnitude , till it looms , vast , over the house of virgo .	388.68233670234304
and lo , wonder of metempsychosis , it is she , the everlasting bride , harbinger of the daystar , the bride , ever virgin .	459.88323353131113
it is she , martha , thou lost one , millicent , the young , the dear , the radiant .	161.98448767998138
how serene does she now arise , a queen among the pleiades , in the penultimate antelucan hour , shod in sandals of bright gold , coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer .	5805.013844116662
it floats , it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams , emerald , sapphire , mauve and heliotrope , sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind , winding , coiling , simply swirling , writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till , after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol , it blazes , alpha , a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of taurus .	7008349.089791438
francis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at school together in conmee’s time .	54.143770734971
he asked about glaucon , alcibiades , pisistratus .	2.66123878927797
where were they now ?	1.7216871347764895
neither knew .	1
you have spoken of the past and its phantoms , stephen said .	15.273903943806168
why think of them ?	1.9923441036368776
if i call them into life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call ?	109.32017161804863
who supposes it ?	1.232356091422945
i , bous stephanoumenos , bullockbefriending bard , am lord and giver of their life .	19.533214162510134
he encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves , smiling at vincent .	15.19492529530349
that answer and those leaves , vincent said to him , will adorn you more fitly when something more , and greatly more , than a capful of light odes can call your genius father .	3427.4922121289032
all who wish you well hope this for you .	5.560654672301262
all desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate , to acclaim you stephaneforos .	31.38021277386287
i heartily wish you may not fail them .	4.565812426283791
o no , vincent lenehan said , laying a hand on the shoulder near him .	45.800863849895336
have no fear .	1.3533475252094196
he could not leave his mother an orphan .	5.200875515367361
the young man’s face grew dark .	2.4705528768020355
all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss .	112.79161283212821
he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart .	31.050876860088337
madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name lenehan as much more .	37.49610825730065
he told them of the race .	3.0178758118829587
the flag fell and , huuh !	2.675063697215606
off , scamper , the mare ran out freshly with o. madden up .	10.422918285774346
she was leading the field .	1.9155319748593753
all hearts were beating .	1.7441262919790528
even phyllis could not contain herself .	2.346299724264942
she waved her scarf and cried huzzah !	3.286209385695496
sceptre wins !	1
but in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level , reached , outstripped her .	339.18285960879416
all was lost now .	1.561931755364658
phyllis was silent her eyes were sad anemones .	4.526963003460212
juno , she cried , i am undone .	5.404905525320584
but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook .	152.22559938544217
a tear fell one only .	1.8879993184516586
a whacking fine whip , said lenehan , is w. lane .	10.653319100349742
four winners yesterday and three today .	2.5601102687290007
what rider is like him ?	2.3928651233103393
mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his .	39.315280980950746
but let us bear it as was the ancient wont .	9.7164575114935
mercy on the luckless !	1.6729046723311658
poor sceptre !	1
he said with a light sigh .	2.8667402487567326
she is not the filly that she was .	5.059619249585516
never , by this hand , shall we behold such another .	11.205762189828391
by gad , sir , a queen of them .	7.201588504825045
do you remember her , vincent ?	3.3474375771449476
i wish you could have seen my queen today , vincent said .	18.709280418887136
how young she was and radiant ( lalage were scarce fair beside her ) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin , i do not know the right name of it .	2506.797446084366
the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us .	81.63227905399472
in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge .	1051.505972590945
but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close .	716.3992577569126
a week ago she lay ill , four days on the couch , but today she was free , blithe , mocked at peril .	204.69189824798306
she is more taking then .	2.0282516741439336
her posies too !	1.2394729082131801
mad romp that she is , she had pulled her fill as we reclined together .	26.725037654779914
and in your ear , my friend , you will not think who met us as we left the field .	209.96520285010652
conmee himself !	1
he was walking by the hedge , reading , i think a brevier book with , i doubt not , a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page .	3739.8840451742294
the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion , feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her .	732.1959315169687
when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries .	44.94681075726132
but he had been kind .	2.0330162910920198
in going by he had blessed us .	4.079138503651422
the gods too are ever kind , lenehan said .	5.622693085583791
if i had poor luck with bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely .	34.858276700023424
he was laying his hand upon a winejar malachi saw it and withheld his act , pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label .	365.61374168320054
warily , malachi whispered , preserve a druid silence .	4.3701270161284835
his soul is far away .	2.518175654975207
it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born .	36.0544036644243
any object , intensely regarded , may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods .	63.618696710656316
do you not think it , stephen ?	4.821212549969308
theosophos told me so , stephen answered , whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law .	127.97691794560923
the lords of the moon , theosophos told me , an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation .	4856.584726916765
however , as a matter of fact though , the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character , was not the case at all .	22747.38946024534
the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop .	27680.800000505424
during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton-on-trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance .	349539.89505237376
he was simply and solely , as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself , which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings , after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf , recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn .	1961101.648449552
eventually , however , both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with , also at the same time , however , a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place .	184450184833.1961
the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life .	33.834692973436994
neither place nor council was lacking in dignity .	3.222197602949863
the debaters were the keenest in the land , the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital .	105.67674464838228
the high hall of horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic .	839.7827915358084
a gallant scene in truth it made .	3.3486014119731764
crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb , his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway .	512.1769104147936
there too , opposite to him , was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom .	69.08684058518986
next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello , the eccentric , while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden .	326.43421536817743
the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan .	17811.081927762218
lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion , while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator , fresh from the hippodrome , and that vigilant wanderer , soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour , but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come .	31637656086.57302
it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s. dedalus’ ( div .	94.30488775876582
scep .	1
) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods .	21.16097916334957
science , it cannot be too often repeated , deals with tangible phenomena .	12.635582271932885
the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can .	296.4371020144139
there may be , it is true , some questions which science cannot answer at present such as the first problem submitted by mr l. bloom ( pubb .	719.995847839819
canv .	1
) regarding the future determination of sex .	3.1222534887488114
must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary ( the postmenstrual period , assert others ) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it , as most embryologists incline to opine , such as culpepper , spallanzani , blumenbach , lusk , hertwig , leopold and valenti , a mixture of both ?	2942099.880265449
this would be tantamount to a cooperation ( one of nature’s favourite devices ) between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position , succubitus felix of the passive element .	5123.665024898423
the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality .	13.123857992043439
it is interesting because , as he pertinently remarks , we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways .	416.2845212207105
mr m. mulligan ( hyg .	1.7142133736797038
et eug .	1
doc .	1
) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids , pulmonary complaints etc .	12.774036222753908
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust .	3.0546693990479308
these factors , he alleged , and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets , hideous publicity posters , religious ministers of all denominations , mutilated soldiers and sailors , exposed scorbutic cardrivers , the suspended carcases of dead animals , paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas these , he said , were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race .	585491.1424137974
kalipedia , he prophesied , would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life , genuinely good music , agreeable literature , light philosophy , instructive pictures , plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo , artistic coloured photographs of prize babies , all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner .	12706563.857447878
mr j. crotthers ( disc .	1.8382289054118666
bacc .	1
) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect , private or official , culminating in the exposure of newborn infants , the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide .	590337.2094535193
although the former ( we are thinking of neglect ) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative .	1875.9873212117398
in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do , all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions .	42996.81412514309
an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v. lynch ( bacc .	13.274133010397309
arith .	1
) that both natality and mortality , as well as all other phenomena of evolution , tidal movements , lunar phases , blood temperatures , diseases in general , everything , in fine , in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained .	3060934.7888054685
still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood ( though other children of the same marriage do not ) must certainly , in the poet’s words , give us pause .	41723.70685690163
nature , we may rest assured , has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence ( modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal ) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development , an arrangement which , though productive of pain to some of our feelings ( notably the maternal ), is nevertheless , some of us think , in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest .	852429020450.793
mr s. dedalus’ ( div .	1.2551256216630193
scep .	1
) remark ( or should it be called an interruption ?	6.177659495817246
) that an omnivorous being which can masticate , deglute , digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition , corpulent professional gentlemen , not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns , might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob , reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to .	4463756.414932014
for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being , it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother .	16457540.863529244
in a recent public controversy with mr l. bloom ( pubb .	4.939754889554625
canv .	1
) which took place in the commons’ hall of the national maternity hospital , 29 , 30 and 31 holles street , of which , as is well known , dr a. horne ( lic .	3561.654118614025
in midw .	1
, f. k. q. c. p. i. ) is the able and popular master , he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag ( an esthete’s allusion , presumably , to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes the act of sexual congress ) she must let it out again or give it life , as he phrased it , to save her own .	230953558.57274
at the risk of her own , was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor , none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered .	927.7027263482865
meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy accouchement .	15.260648782074657
it had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor .	12.488580687498573
all that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped .	20.08265188301178
she had .	1
she had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy .	14.622689018190103
those who have passed on , who have gone before , are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene .	484.7055304778392
reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes , that longing hunger for baby fingers ( a pretty sight it is to see ), in the first bloom of her new motherhood , breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to one above , the universal husband .	522292.7375264031
and as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more , to have her dear doady there with her to share her joy , to lay in his arms that mite of god’s clay , the fruit of their lawful embraces .	88934.7555376876
he is older now ( you and i may whisper it ) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the ulster bank , college green branch .	27520.126953790936
o doady , loved one of old , faithful lifemate now , it may never be again , that faroff time of the roses !	375.69247970719505
with the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days .	14.979028395605063
god !	1
how beautiful now across the mist of years !	4.5893406627969995
but their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside , hers and his , charley , mary alice , frederick albert ( if he had lived ), mamy , budgy ( victoria frances ), tom , violet constance louisa , darling little bobsy ( called after our famous hero of the south african war , lord bobs of waterford and candahar ) and now this last pledge of their union , a purefoy if ever there was one , with the true purefoy nose .	566487999.9100964
young hopeful will be christened mortimer edward after the influential third cousin of mr purefoy in the treasury remembrancer’s office , dublin castle .	132.3104784467145
and so time wags on but father cronion has dealt lightly here .	6.510354140169112
no , let no sigh break from that bosom , dear gentle mina .	15.60621205757733
and doady , knock the ashes from your pipe , the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you ( may it be the distant day !	712.3336092261811
) and dout the light whereby you read in the sacred book for the oil too has run low , and so with a tranquil heart to bed , to rest .	1613.8226677326788
he knows and will call in his own good time .	8.260706026197616
you too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man’s part .	9.852701424036852
sir , to you my hand .	3.5245844385163645
well done , thou good and faithful servant !	4.910574183150628
there are sins or ( let us call them as the world calls them ) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait .	5555.943179034693
he may suffer their memory to grow dim , let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise .	3534.714178414435
yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances , a vision or a dream , or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast , at midnight , when he is now filled with wine .	4226878.639986474
not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath , not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past , silent , remote , reproachful .	29909.034612362833
the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there , imposed , as it seemed , by habit or some studied trick , upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness , a flair for the cruder things of life .	155979.6961220057
a scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory , evoked , it would seem , by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there ( as some thought ) with their immediate pleasures .	16068.171802406121
a shaven space of lawn one soft may evening , the wellremembered grove of lilacs at roundtown , purple and white , fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop , one by its fellow , with a brief alert shock .	931807.9646151883
and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood , floey , atty , tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in her pose then , our lady of the cherries , a comely brace of them pendent from an ear , bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit .	85673140.42363982
a lad of four or five in linseywoolsey ( blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched ) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands .	6457.603446739404

quietude of custody , rather , befitting their station in that house , the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in bethlehem of juda long ago .	663.5482262489214
but as before the lightning the serried stormclouds , heavy with preponderant excess of moisture , in swollen masses turgidly distended , compass earth and sky in one vast slumber , impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent , so and not otherwise was the transformation , violent and instantaneous , upon the utterance of the word .	136897998.15036058
burke’s !	1
outflings my lord stephen , giving the cry , and a tag and bobtail of all them after , cockerel , jackanapes , welsher , pilldoctor , punctual bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear , ashplants , bilbos , panama hats and scabbards , zermatt alpenstocks and what not .	82401.90595039296
