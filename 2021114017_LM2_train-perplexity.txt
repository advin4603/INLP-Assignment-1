pride & prejudice.	1
chapter i.	1
it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	351.618239436141
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	247760.49506395482
my dear mr. bennet said his lady to him one day , have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ?	199.10352929097354
mr. bennet replied that he had not .	3.5834002773754188
but it is returned she ; for mrs. long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	132.79192930799118
mr. bennet made no answer .	1.7340455415415983
do not you want to know who has taken it ?	8.866795588945738
cried his wife impatiently .	1.59677064630425
you want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it .	37.88155665417839
this was invitation enough .	1.4973301634890086
why , my dear , you must know , mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .	6927554355.937456
what is his name ?	1.8988286563933054
bingley .	1
is he married or single ?	2.074642335287718
oh !	1
single , my dear , to be sure !	4.560642570183298
a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .	18.27785628495101
what a fine thing for our girls !	4.048577306909395
how so ?	1
how can it affect them ?	2.076665551865953
my dear mr. bennet replied his wife , how can you be so tiresome !	19.776174626023902
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them .	24.379793707367778
is that his design in settling here ?	3.8277041055052643
design !	1
nonsense , how can you talk so !	4.0482413273457905
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes .	462.18291230793983
i see no occasion for that .	2.1950718210233835
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr. bingley might like you the best of the party .	153108.44173935763
my dear , you flatter me .	2.6979511633281072
i certainly have had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	106.8980615248328
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	84.75433424851587
in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of .	34.42148431810044
but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood .	87.99168257191751
it is more than i engage for , i assure you .	10.667421095345201
but consider your daughters .	1.6269905450027895
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	16.54332305825507
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	497.45502802636645
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not .	143.87737204454479
you are over scrupulous surely .	1.683226861982682
i dare say mr. bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy .	1099046.9746571209
i desire you will do no such thing .	4.469743653006177
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia .	4970.925142170117
but you are always giving her the preference .	6.523096695121624
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he ; they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters .	4021.163121122469
mr. bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	18.353235556516385
you take delight in vexing me .	2.2433908435460523
you have no compassion on my poor nerves .	3.9538638432875644
you mistake me , my dear .	2.100648843512165
i have a high respect for your nerves .	4.316876816418035
they are my old friends .	1.853271036087031
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least .	19.616336837367765
ah !	1
you do not know what i suffer .	4.571831683628332
but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .	303.37223805545136
it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them .	66.23232366749062
depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all .	76.53795681008721
mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	4206.077859016237
her mind was less difficult to develope .	3.4967229483958118
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	21.609227122920878
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	3.932376639707813
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .	65.37417905548133
chapter ii.	1
mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley .	20.60142703082975
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	15185.910503680914
it was then disclosed in the following manner .	4.649672304525569
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with ,	31.28478636184645
i hope mr. bingley will like it lizzy .	4.877464050444656
we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes said her mother resentfully , since we are not to visit .	445.3114190828467
but you forget , mama said elizabeth , that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him .	568.2920166762676
i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing .	9.737408281392746
she has two nieces of her own .	3.674371139994229
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her .	20.17653814768005
no more have i said mr. bennet ; and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	236.3787058249648
mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	188.12249406484528
don't keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven's sake !	6.93888408101178
have a little compassion on my nerves .	2.7520231377138824
you tear them to pieces .	2.2282037768485314
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father ; she times them ill .	26.98529468222004
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully .	7.390684307843074
when is your next ball to be , lizzy ?	9.075025178195101
to-morrow fortnight .	1
aye , so it is cried her mother , and mrs. long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself .	34274.4437125618
then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr. bingley to her .	146.0232312741381
impossible , mr. bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ?	198.99140920662475
i honour your circumspection .	1.3889666584823397
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	3.6810836091107633
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	27.078465946269603
but if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself .	506356.47718494985
the girls stared at their father .	3.0811845333074275
mrs. bennet said only , nonsense , nonsense !	5.614037754735064
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?	4.2173717152420025
cried he .	1
do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	67.18905772814698
i cannot quite agree with you there .	3.594706736540532
what say you , mary ?	2.777528163486877
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts .	105.74508472086502
mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	19.876206513869615
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued , let us return to mr. bingley .	28.941791855003583
i am sick of mr. bingley cried his wife .	5.974334649025649
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before ?	41.287356173492775
if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him .	73.75786298956702
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .	144.18651156389262
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	45965.147895378206
how good it was in you , my dear mr. bennet !	7.963341328411317
but i knew i should persuade you at last .	9.467289027809203
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	23.963430549488383
well , how pleased i am !	2.9737785980745475
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	727.5150705793451
now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse said mr. bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	4553.087731521724
what an excellent father you have , girls said she , when the door was shut .	40.55820202106622
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter .	303.5754247390055
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	7661.485477353704
lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball .	615.1461246744425
oh !	1
said lydia stoutly , i am not afraid ; for though i am the youngest , i'm the tallest .	65.47038764707912
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	650.7935759168165
chapter iii.	1
not all that mrs. bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley .	3146.078694546708
they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas .	16377.15423333937
her report was highly favourable .	2.0780305531923893
sir william had been delighted with him .	3.529618922602271
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	889.6718357087373
nothing could be more delightful !	2.277856874815544
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr. bingley's heart were entertained .	296.9835134075123
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs. bennet to her husband , and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for .	10467.542958740936
in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	169.8876475161885
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .	2620.659546483321
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	600.6093960057383
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	4497.063388214181
mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , &c .	228.32193357124663
mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted .	2.0760079579781094
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be .	286109.69971293915
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	230059.29988904347
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin .	31040.665367506157
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; mr. bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	5982.983246209955
mr. bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	72.09926474642754
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	13.700522176033196
his brother-in-law , mr. hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	3219658.9242277667
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	151644167306.27396
mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .	47744.98562687561
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .	3.7120063037142974
what a contrast between him and his friend !	5.114654303220472
mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	21316.879157705305
his character was decided .	1.5444090264952863
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	350.4462679445429
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	2339.0751282559745
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr. bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	22321203.731275532
come , darcy said he , i must have you dance .	11.595896793261398
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	14.159380370857178
you had much better dance .	2.2837815176422
i certainly shall not .	1.8607014275808567
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner .	37.09240425712063
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	10.924040524520999
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	1245.769175050989
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley , for a kingdom !	24.32974115453845
upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	4137.0286881904685
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr. darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet .	153.3997614480856
oh !	1
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !	5.955119908805331
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable .	726.7674916385168
do let me ask my partner to introduce you .	7.592443872486986
which do you mean ?	1.9930913188131945
and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	1460834.006330481
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .	116.03220664671639
mr. bingley followed his advice .	1.9721105563240828
mr. darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	23.03102952097358
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	843.0358442227486
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	8.517954150558232
mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party .	18.175552852473896
mr. bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	34.554468683351246
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	176.47199482442338
elizabeth felt jane's pleasure .	1.5107187186299034
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	148897.22439884744
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	354.78001465546413
they found mr. bennet still up .	2.8386282653791146
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	5839.420062750294
he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	2080.120680938799
oh !	1
my dear mr. bennet as she entered the room , we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	260.7420450590195
i wish you had been there .	3.6776021949570787
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	9.534787324260455
every body said how well she looked ; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	158.51002995332888
only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	1638.4247821034305
first of all , he asked miss lucas .	6.556173273057763
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance .	83350.54058541119
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	131.45676102112253
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger ----	2199.29082344468
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently , he would not have danced half so much !	188.33889223248644
for god's sake , say no more of his partners .	8.255605862747284
oh !	1
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !	4.661932883689686
oh !	1
my dear continued mrs. bennet , i am quite delighted with him .	8.91812056317686
he is so excessively handsome !	2.304958361691258
and his sisters are charming women .	2.6014994845857657
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	18.96745341229125
i dare say the lace upon mrs. hurst's gown ----	3.5617664515235066
here she was interrupted again .	2.2546265345203165
mr. bennet protested against any description of finery .	3.7156342979894688
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy .	1204.1554556175415
but i can assure you she added , that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	4403.1161851834695
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	8.37570075651683
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	26.705822657617336
not handsome enough to dance with !	2.4125174417852864
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	140.047416231946
i quite detest the man .	2.076660243121724
chapter iv.	1
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	5050.1923889759255
he is just what a young man ought to be said she , sensible , good humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners !	800.3008869417907
-- so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !	8.700008071362099
he is also handsome replied elizabeth , which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	97.91644646222147
his character is thereby complete .	1.9448735669586987
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .	40.25226599810739
i did not expect such a compliment .	4.795745083028705
did not you ?	1.290688726458405
i did for you .	1.6684029691584186
but that is one great difference between us .	4.86284399223583
compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .	9.502253016822204
what could be more natural than his asking you again ?	11.47854282384284
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	88.65152824667717
no thanks to his gallantry for that .	4.385582966979611
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him .	60.019727827820525
you have liked many a stupider person .	3.3825596310419677
dear lizzy !	1
oh !	1
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	34.04378418580812
you never see a fault in any body .	5.39663883516424
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	7.9017710550739935
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life .	20.605414289271152
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think .	87.65531069127644
i know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder .	18.350871010609637
with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	42.44524198594523
affectation of candour is common enough ; -- one meets it every where .	16.482212287262914
but to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone .	4157.294836812133
and so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	16.370208568808906
their manners are not equal to his .	4.400604627220527
certainly not ; at first .	2.5523335532672538
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	12.174143645317763
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her .	2324.843043236742
elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	2098927.9170877766
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .	3345.062928243557
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	4656816.1271740105
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	4321.937909890839
mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .	1785.783176446844
-- mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	30020973.718026366
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	32496594.98879348
mr. bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .	258.80729140502496
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	17175.724131235813
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	52.5783165541289
-- bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	7544.617826404806
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	74.57479418750303
in understanding darcy was the superior .	3.2502287826813747
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .	6.602367214986349
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	257.14481827979364
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	7.38162205146852
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .	30.561838956159175
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	13.678078463765239
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	1685629.8829705303
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	40439.89452961873
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	22.579660294436835
mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	8683.758255735167
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	363.6726130449184
chapter v.	1
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate .	47.24046310594841
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty .	4169.162340164051
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	3.5709469357333927
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	154546939.01115808
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	254.27739570917356
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st .	6.823693217413282
james's had made him courteous .	2.1270708433301984
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet .	152.04543553148255
-- they had several children .	2.127299269461103
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was elizabeth's intimate friend .	86.75929205303186
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate .	10789.490996707895
you began the evening well , charlotte said mrs. bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas .	43.95220723066453
you were mr. bingley's first choice .	2.5509281099546537
yes ; -- but he seemed to like his second better .	13.59151273862827
oh !	1
-- you mean jane , i suppose -- because he danced with her twice .	25.097360024100034
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her -- indeed i rather believe he did -- i heard something about it -- but i hardly know what -- something about mr. robinson .	8803.616869665613
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson ; did not i mention it to you ?	82.50521983990045
mr. robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	6449.543489697124
and his answering immediately to the last question -- oh !	5.984615587978361
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point .	36.65988810104749
upon my word !	1.267288701322093
-- well , that was very decided indeed -- that does seem as if ---- but however , it may all come to nothing you know .	819.0518457898866
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte .	14.05399096498635
mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	51.80010060003734
-- poor eliza !	1.2257738364547512
-- to be only just tolerable .	2.9056621755393115
i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	9005.194414193345
mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips .	105.68805286240661
are you quite sure , ma'am ?	3.1064834722228634
-- is not there a little mistake ?	4.138922709711782
said jane .	1
-- i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her .	5.630207084074681
aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; -- but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to .	5469.4430443146675
miss bingley told me said jane , that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	33.705960134874424
with them he is remarkably agreeable .	2.599180198555567
i do not believe a word of it , my dear .	7.191528915175156
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long .	31.115813973140778
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise .	110413.50143020398
i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long said miss lucas , but i wish he had danced with eliza .	196.13658892826348
another time , lizzy said her mother , i would not dance with him if i were you .	99.53773942158969
i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you never to dance with him .	34.80986342227721
his pride said miss lucas , does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	309.94896332115377
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	1635.5875485679758
if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud .	37.71689137381926
that is very true replied elizabeth , and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine .	127.5948922228335
pride observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , is a very common failing i believe .	118.68035911401985
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	562844.3591632621
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	20.173480404477836
a person may be proud without being vain .	4.774430887614288
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us .	107.98029690477382
if i were as rich as mr. darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , i should not care how proud i was .	848.6511361365673
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	23.636050736825727
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs. bennet ; and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly .	3447.676826590011
the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	351.5390771907307
chapter vi.	1
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield .	9.447179105746862
the visit was returned in due form .	3.5012389555518815
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest .	280145.5375070377
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	9929798.012925046
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	285204984128.2692
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .	5.121210406346903
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte , to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	1585.5161985116824
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	13170.371739601189
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	264.3550488942095
we can all begin freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	2340.5540115908475
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .	54.83030576098149
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .	231.24220876601123
but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	27.03437303103634
if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too .	111.82918620554729
remember , eliza , that he does not know jane's disposition as you do .	15.789479319466968
but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out .	196.26836690582468
perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	8.527204964599424
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	17847.888329350757
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	63.40605695726181
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses .	116.69062285149725
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth , where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .	68189.13276066765
but these are not jane's feelings ; she is not acting by design .	22.08745453838362
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	145.7870394920727
she has known him only a fortnight .	4.352040788892651
she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	2687.5791710570434
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character .	12.224873003835285
not as you represent it .	2.0712964371838996
had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal .	17406.881881949543
yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded .	5249.994487276622
well said charlotte , i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to-morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	383334.6369612941
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	5.0310766282609825
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .	1178.1732078554337
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	13615.05131574759
you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .	17.178273966162084
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	58.240949703909784
occupied in observing mr. bingley's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	1888.3212290848612
mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	4392.631490630321
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	44764.80369223828
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	4.479581527770165
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	214247.83656341376
of this she was perfectly unaware ; -- to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	6644.193939371721
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	658.0430800041843
his doing so drew her notice .	2.449511146478669
it was at sir william lucas's , where a large party were assembled .	29.102519594538386
what does mr. darcy mean said she to charlotte , by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ?	80.16628550018224
that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer .	8.792894989058269
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .	246.30691904894942
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him .	256.33723540921113
on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said ,	79459.89207426683
did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ?	2188.73138667884
with great energy ; -- but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic .	29.677769153188194
you are severe on us .	2.023994566922545
it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas .	13.432186211096909
i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows .	42.78363159987339
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	13.469316482378888
-- always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !	25.61475263429036
-- if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers .	37717.74969736515
on miss lucas's persevering , however , she added , very well ; if it must be so , it must .	102.14551122062699
and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with -- 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' -- and i shall keep mine to swell my song .	13209.890194487307
her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	4.767717519455734
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	7541174.9096446065
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	19202.96361730992
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	93620643.52481791
mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .	87899.10249010849
what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !	16.086267145557986
-- there is nothing like dancing after all .	4.503241540053482
-- i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies .	9.33302025357708
certainly , sir ; -- and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .	340.937838038815
-- every savage can dance .	1.6823960948379668
sir william only smiled .	1.631230888942702
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; -- and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr. darcy .	2171.907934811498
you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir .	13.892815578400718
yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	13.033706130484733
do you often dance at st .	2.1281122585214263
james's ?	1
never , sir .	1.3730489054998853
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?	22.26274682132403
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it .	35.08730962844707
you have a house in town , i conclude ?	9.006788865468488
mr. darcy bowed .	1.1991878218917267
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas .	3880.0677841049296
he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her ,	116325.9888036956
my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ?	8.098660255358427
-- mr. darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .	109.1624584820886
-- you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you .	90.99362517408963
and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr. darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william ,	23185.867922874295
indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing .	18.47269612573648
-- i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner .	74.66482755980297
mr. darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain .	63.14507287618115
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	57.71680991262467
you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour .	616088.418332559
mr. darcy is all politeness said elizabeth , smiling .	4.082653237418522
he is indeed -- but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ?	1600.187724341215
elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	3.1596180451711406
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley ,	811.423942439648
i can guess the subject of your reverie .	4.937973628939113
i should imagine not .	1.5252543837934622
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion .	1114.2824933810828
i was never more annoyed !	2.298045777531909
the insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	56.241797369299476
-- what would i give to hear your strictures on them !	10.656392078287016
your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you .	5.334644662603628
my mind was more agreeably engaged .	2.8741002728452627
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow .	306.63035179755
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	434.0037680190703
mr. darcy replied with great intrepidity ,	2.8811379460093334
miss elizabeth bennet .	1.4006368450178683
miss elizabeth bennet !	1.394106715333367
repeated miss bingley .	1.394044608727697
i am all astonishment .	1.679591021965688
how long has she been such a favourite ?	6.461377532250389
-- and pray when am i to wish you joy ?	10.034148782350021
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .	13.613681025356488
a lady's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	138.86106825815364
i knew you would be wishing me joy .	4.7817975104257275
nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	66.343751054305
you will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you .	165.99451003886722
he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	3529.205661102776
chapter vii.	1
mr. bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	694565.165286312
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	40.30374323215623
she had a sister married to a mr. philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade .	13157.717143117508
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way .	470265.49815066386
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	95227125.92056023
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters .	16818.17984713932
their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	17.50250516178706
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	16.82293400719638
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	115.7718231560615
mr. philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	47.526466527692236
they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr. bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	7856.900617165351
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr. bennet coolly observed ,	28.218310622726683
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	386.0517820512406
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced .	18.73697152888106
catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london .	148527.54716464516
i am astonished , my dear said mrs. bennet , that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	270.0222109575756
if i wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however .	114.27999866604615
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it .	22.538141164033135
yes -- but as it happens , they are all of them very clever .	38.321983549334824
this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	44.20905802280395
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish .	1055.9501152768519
my dear mr. bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .	118.08898551592407
-- when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	147.25813603505094
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well -- and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals .	48880837.92820144
mama cried lydia , my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library .	25052.75546808505
mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	757.6301655901121
mrs. bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read ,	81.58804546309369
well , jane , who is it from ?	5.115498998813514
what is it about ?	1.8691996962813378
what does he say ?	1.776499439653322
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love .	43.62411635485088
it is from miss bingley said jane , and then read it aloud .	22.134093772958707
my dear friend ,	1.3408100518748174
if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel .	55452.18955829068
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	9.08043101699293
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	16.478184610630606
yours ever ,	1
caroline bingley.	1
with the officers !	1.4248358302984552
cried lydia .	1
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that .	10.325559847418583
dining out said mrs. bennet , that is very unlucky .	9.413135985002894
can i have the carriage ?	2.527241214675373
said jane .	1
no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night .	651.7530884037764
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth , if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home .	263.8503201698751
oh !	1
but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley's chaise to go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs .	108.4153169277875
i had much rather go in the coach .	5.153793600059139
but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure .	35.02336012633642
they are wanted in the farm , mr. bennet , are not they ?	15.339274406134146
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them .	16.421022028304733
but if you have got them to-day said elizabeth , my mother's purpose will be answered .	32.06490579881039
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	29.42352327606101
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	329.81586747865083
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	26.19754363105052
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	14.134341154838888
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back .	30.475928966243465
this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	7.776060113916111
said mrs. bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	181.04075329714445
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	44.903082970200636
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth	26.570942405342777
my dearest lizzy ,	1.293885571690789
i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	202.8699578913096
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better .	22.657491265917354
they insist also on my seeing mr. jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	20141.494789366545
yours , &c .	1.0048770515948573
well , my dear said mr. bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr. bingley , and under your orders .	653423.7823922279
oh !	1
i am not at all afraid of her dying .	5.2212506959789335
people do not die of little trifling colds .	4.053650133819021
she will be taken good care of .	3.604601614366144
as long as she stays there , it is all very well .	15.528188955442912
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage .	28.287616815368505
elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	4249.870743466997
she declared her resolution .	1.6978840713864511
how can you be so silly cried her mother , as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	209.55755862252835
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there .	12.405404668698464
i shall be very fit to see jane -- which is all i want .	41.267712774587515
is this a hint to me , lizzy said her father , to send for the horses ?	78.6818170262974
no , indeed .	1.4336894942700429
i do not wish to avoid the walk .	5.606517818455494
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles .	31.97691722614684
i shall be back by dinner .	2.447163447076646
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary , but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required .	7501.25236747403
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia .	15.627137564827574
-- elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	21.379268144703502
if we make haste said lydia , as they walked along , perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes .	217.9973573017184
in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	13035594.376627477
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .	385.5656251519538
-- that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	130867.94873222178
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness .	1424.1720130497456
-- mr. darcy said very little , and mr. hurst nothing at all .	19.426660340133797
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	747.8848362432797
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	4.958854706709818
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	11.036680245187634
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	186.1215018533976
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	172076.21355085185
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	2565.409563168073
elizabeth silently attended her .	1.6591602907163407
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane .	2344.1509495505484
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	221552.50550785928
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	26.063024957481872
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	2250.3418086395513
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so .	70.27647900143738
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present .	308049.31104168185
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	463.4109498046187
chapter viii.	1
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	75.99491393529053
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	2498.6636287325464
jane was by no means better .	1.7558750743965668
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	19742290.13403371
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	115.42315333587365
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	6079.875039522301
she had very little notice from any but him .	5.629658007176725
miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr. hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	5797809.683390947
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	399.21135548789533
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	1418.6166157480304
mrs. hurst thought the same , and added ,	5.274733692608622
she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	53.29664758895469
i shall never forget her appearance this morning .	5.011119633575869
she really looked almost wild .	1.8632533346714022
she did indeed , louisa .	2.6631694313936514
i could hardly keep my countenance .	3.403708620393796
very nonsensical to come at all !	2.8430984360566147
why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	39.836696585207555
her hair so untidy , so blowsy !	2.7211338658674213
yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office .	7409.354407992777
your picture may be very exact , louisa said bingley ; but this was all lost upon me .	78.87984357437915
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	59.54464441199326
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice .	2.5313060263177936
you observed it , mr. darcy , i am sure said miss bingley ; and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition .	4912.900202694608
certainly not .	1
to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	1055.469758283569
what could she mean by it ?	3.1996849480912157
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum .	82.02832035442424
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley .	23.59066023399696
i am afraid , mr. darcy observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes .	231.3341498925349
not at all he replied ; they were brightened by the exercise .	14.927572680279935
-- a short pause followed this speech , and mrs. hurst began again .	20.05951769490607
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled .	678.79180983877
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it .	114.0756991022188
i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton .	54.3179277450957
yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside .	15.918116933826642
that is capital added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	9.981783527990592
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley , it would not make them one jot less agreeable .	84.5813526558157
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy .	70.87921826348035
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	1027.1211441047926
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	462.5789488579697
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	110028.99683545218
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	708943.8636567132
mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment .	3.7923524172954597
do you prefer reading to cards ?	2.4570711178804805
said he ; that is rather singular .	4.27920042751868
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley , despises cards .	4.357707299930402
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else .	14.461831788724842
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth ; i am not a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things .	453.53236653889877
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley ; and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well .	723.1667538779232
elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	106.66841019914604
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .	21.254286256495426
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into .	8370.025892550611
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	21.97196607600161
i am astonished said miss bingley , that my father should have left so small a collection of books .	108.46348091368928
-- what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr. darcy !	17.23129910176576
it ought to be good he replied , it has been the work of many generations .	25.972027215693814
and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	55.36785693052847
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these .	20.340994525890743
neglect !	1
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	33.15525451466641
charles , when you build your house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley .	43.77927845725818
i wish it may .	1.594846181036519
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model .	260.99634614165274
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire .	6.923165544884144
with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it .	30.87915362886533
i am talking of possibilities , charles .	3.151503492076498
upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation .	135.3549369271465
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	422516.608552634
is miss darcy much grown since the spring ?	4.090203591112358
said miss bingley ; will she be as tall as i am ?	14.0277086301476
i think she will .	1.942272693650328
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height , or rather taller .	11.551243730824865
how i long to see her again !	2.9465778269203304
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	6.373443629135739
such a countenance , such manners !	3.208708431155729
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	3.563321638678142
her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite .	3.3975196984819678
it is amazing to me said bingley , how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are .	452.64278312572856
all young ladies accomplished !	1.7111170821934854
my dear charles , what do you mean ?	5.533700866457544
yes , all of them , i think .	6.521022104912708
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	3.5159208766069456
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .	15419.449329322088
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy , has too much truth .	23.705936318243147
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	166.750465444858
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	39.56701691899127
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished .	209.0321059373328
nor i , i am sure said miss bingley .	7.006895434529054
then observed elizabeth , you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman .	38.888110304411796
yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it .	8.158725740714925
oh !	1
certainly cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	260.4652356688265
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved .	14974128.214854848
all this she must possess added darcy , and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .	833.5572958047744
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .	13.627329420406978
i rather wonder now at your knowing any .	4.833716198404124
are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?	49.89476665561017
i never saw such a woman .	4.150801949939267
i never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	105.89783916360503
mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr. hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	144172.58018545576
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	40.29995538996661
eliza bennet said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds .	129881.84217466803
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art .	31.756398515561543
undoubtedly replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	259.0712596407029
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable .	2.262017368715477
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	30.644263405144795
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	186.40417402623828
bingley urged mr. jones's being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	6209.537984256489
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ; and it was settled that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better .	94195.45718677869
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .	12.971773546957682
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	26674.825195737452
chapter ix.	1
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	1902544.7699199254
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	1873.230192774117
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	16.022160716949912
mrs. bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	57.754060566544716
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs. bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield .	209931.0568149947
she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	2189.649283042971
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	1099.0586590138207
bingley met them with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected .	66.50521071928068
indeed i have , sir was her answer .	7.052518602918378
she is a great deal too ill to be moved .	10.028224143184016
mr. jones says we must not think of moving her .	7.412648991031938
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness .	6.6343409872560155
removed !	1
cried bingley .	1
it must not be thought of .	3.1961309677856056
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal .	26.087791058754288
you may depend upon it , madam said miss bingley , with cold civility , that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us .	1262.3282416563195
mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	2.6041133026008745
i am sure she added , if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with .	44155717.721461244
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	13.279368827105456
you have a sweet room here , mr. bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	55.8100153704128
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield .	29.097862690330704
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease .	174.12519237195343
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he ; and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes .	1471.3316012888995
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here .	9.71000122869898
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth .	16.659112938790386
you begin to comprehend me , do you ?	6.26533900757096
cried he , turning towards her .	2.9556816226565634
oh !	1
yes -- i understand you perfectly .	2.9958411912590717
i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful .	197.07802241656196
that is as it happens .	2.801300425222251
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours .	116.72445777229088
lizzy cried her mother , remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home .	560.1423038537204
i did not know before continued bingley immediately , that you were a studier of character .	40.55359159219159
it must be an amusing study .	2.449282344415341
yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing .	6.071582328328029
they have at least that advantage .	3.269630814454133
the country said darcy , can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	23.392528198468096
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society .	12.785824406190766
but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever .	80.68876642641803
yes , indeed cried mrs. bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	37.23463648590996
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town .	109.12040837736421
every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	120.86015391754665
mrs. bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	40.911189670227785
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	141.00805928817388
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr. bingley ?	26.002866971874372
when i am in the country he replied , i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same .	1421.787163951981
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either .	22.331207358841638
aye -- that is because you have the right disposition .	11.877035666227872
but that gentleman looking at darcy , seemed to think the country was nothing at all .	49.413048133444306
indeed , mama , you are mistaken said elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	18.73396191681947
you quite mistook mr. darcy .	1.8490957187303818
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true .	1348.6997408763511
certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	1102.5426215494572
i know we dine with four and twenty families .	5.710326900889303
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .	16.08643365696335
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile .	72.1935162500065
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away .	1654.6305267775574
yes , she called yesterday with her father .	5.364909856184061
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr. bingley -- is not he ?	25.65237659440494
so much the man of fashion !	3.498500025648865
so genteel and so easy !	2.3838418951393114
-- he has always something to say to every body .	8.743140947211545
-- that is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter .	611.8649506902725
did charlotte dine with you ?	2.2731430978094154
no , she would go home .	3.0697489028272877
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	4.552995460422946
for my part , mr. bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently .	292.7807353905712
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you .	199.77531678068365
it is a pity they are not handsome !	5.008339360650651
not that i think charlotte so very plain -- but then she is our particular friend .	36.76649336896378
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley .	5.755675298451398
oh !	1
dear , yes ; -- but you must own she is very plain .	22.382366519597326
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane's beauty .	15.225822339951437
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane -- one does not often see any body better looking .	1119.7651736338337
it is what every body says .	3.3947906946373263
i do not trust my own partiality .	3.35558420232576
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	29962.18958115803
but however he did not .	1.7549806428257109
perhaps he thought her too young .	3.2884863478812454
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .	19.711738906679223
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently .	4.618593440853253
there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way .	45.35452303534981
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !	8.776225729134378
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy .	14.503832791163786
of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	6.6190704185761815
every thing nourishes what is strong already .	2.9546583361551297
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away .	313.2973560857324
darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	88.16045915639621
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy .	48200.67828154032
mr. bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	401.6186311075408
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs. bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	107.74307415475744
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	14.31815971864027
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield .	68350.44201767359
lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	4615.052940628438
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	6858.2580626508625
she was very equal therefore to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	32356.381808239854
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	12.711594493035363
i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	6196.022622080243
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill .	18.29065276655246
lydia declared herself satisfied .	1.6527024940961597
oh !	1
yes -- it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again .	786.0067718375637
and when you have given your ball she added , i shall insist on their giving one also .	43.673712794213515
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not .	26.689644514059363
mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on fine eyes .	1984316.3778184538
chapter x.	1
the day passed much as the day before had done .	10.56533583577826
mrs. hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	6888.39453704644
the loo table , however , did not appear .	4.501518424676728
mr. darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	1963.7537979770354
mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet , and mrs. hurst was observing their game .	36.3433263889998
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion .	110.57303940647596
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	290111.0194731858
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter !	14.806464312140637
he made no answer .	1.58358876292269
you write uncommonly fast .	1.4964848704186828
you are mistaken .	1.4441572740797144
i write rather slowly .	1.4965600778469703
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	29.981321630796106
letters of business too !	1.6522363277965808
how odious i should think them !	2.7940016896817292
it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours .	36.08290220757483
pray tell your sister that i long to see her .	8.458671683916586
i have already told her so once , by your desire .	13.619735056877522
i am afraid you do not like your pen .	6.1400023390506355
let me mend it for you .	2.8225209873377803
i mend pens remarkably well .	1.8303359199360247
thank you -- but i always mend my own .	6.974408575432322
how can you contrive to write so even ?	4.056494587463883
he was silent .	1.3985725402344562
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's .	62517.78917283657
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ?	16.41463167449502
-- at present i have not room to do them justice .	11.383468704574925
oh !	1
it is of no consequence .	2.3639381038646707
i shall see her in january .	2.7994912200682296
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr. darcy ?	15.62863470630022
they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine .	41.79908820863309
it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill .	231.60949849357758
that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline cried her brother -- because he does not write with ease .	304.52990057146565
he studies too much for words of four syllables .	5.572007144706294
-- do not you , darcy ?	3.5875442774940782
my style of writing is very different from yours .	6.969836649017523
oh !	1
cried miss bingley , charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .	9.05222709107825
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest .	9.787618939831146
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents .	531.4014883277704
your humility , mr. bingley said elizabeth , must disarm reproof .	7.853763135460466
nothing is more deceitful said darcy , than the appearance of humility .	8.65891105221556
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast .	11.78817267144507
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ?	23.885031765822685
the indirect boast ; -- for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	53214.60967747631
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	580.7815761127565
when you told mrs. bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?	89466498.39238848
nay cried bingley , this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	384.81047543493366
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment .	1047.0432987156748
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies .	64.87709549370514
i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .	129.72058857192533
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month .	70251459.94089615
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth , that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	102.24594161788168
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself .	13.297839237215953
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley , by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	319.51916030735055
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could .	501566.62425694615
would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?	87.2030183464982
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself .	42.6649964549535
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged .	109.83392997809571
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety .	843827.8400353706
to yield readily -- easily -- to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you .	52.767601229847784
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either .	13.31616042892168
you appear to me , mr. darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	56.0955757893987
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	274.9154216013557
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley .	42.21323703400057
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	175.58943115373427
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?	447467.070052563
will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?	27598.95496699233
by all means cried bingley ; let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of .	50709.9552186826
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference .	1127.0693513263375
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do .	15782.75627997515
mr. darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .	114.40816666187357
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	99.13377964612022
i see your design , bingley said his friend .	6.739433908850933
-- you dislike an argument , and want to silence this .	11.167533216604902
perhaps i do .	1.404966866580061
arguments are too much like disputes .	3.076213100497535
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me .	3906.1399328561893
what you ask said elizabeth , is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr. darcy had much better finish his letter .	123.02167504510847
mr. darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	9.681175421322425
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	100.55730041327087
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	4419.038410772295
mrs. hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr. darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	11094.560063237757
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	11715.350273886084
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	17081.895187401213
the supposition did not pain her .	2.453222232916738
she liked him too little to care for his approbation .	10.447816752781778
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr. darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her --	1060.2133027788038
do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?	80.92279519426445
she smiled , but made no answer .	3.9062720767670713
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	13.830420396427895
oh !	1
said she , i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	97.41411550223964
you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	19455.719605750302
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare .	1410.144244944799
indeed i do not dare .	1.5291696497419394
elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	728086.0344982222
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	256.2884311796502
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth .	4909.505956937684
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	548.697904212634
i hope said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .	1592459.5800240575
-- and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses .	726.3622973035833
have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?	11.3734263619938
oh !	1
yes .	1
-- do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley .	60.740255708700396
put them next to your great uncle the judge .	6.512919305662466
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines .	25.526026591118107
as for your elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	325.7529697034247
it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied .	717.4853511088601
at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself .	40.78187163998914
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	164.82071178542245
you used us abominably ill answered mrs. hurst , in running away without telling us that you were coming out .	107.3865877942603
then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself .	43.419759718995294
the path just admitted three .	1.877716392386521
mr. darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , --	5.4281608499779015
this walk is not wide enough for our party .	5.848356528715432
we had better go into the avenue .	3.759457061419308
but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered ,	49.67463604018749
no , no ; stay where you are .	3.968146216568502
-- you are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	7.501536134068147
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	3.900808631317814
good bye .	1
she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	256.811970395342
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	53.30048858391233
chapter xi.	1
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	14679450.944819354
their powers of conversation were considerable .	2.8260358075846375
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	87.860569887887
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object .	36.10802184496025
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	247.4905242164439
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr. hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation .	5646.799603627305
he was full of joy and attention .	3.4861712863039407
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	39403.61777000119
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	26.90609097411735
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	27.87126970176554
when tea was over , mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain .	33.530886008794965
she had obtained private intelligence that mr. darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	143.6910891472385
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	458.02481612518585
mr. hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	108.36718167176754
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs. hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet .	11329.821609022054
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	13884.158853949184
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .	96.41305208503968
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	525932.7685741811
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	7.555721655161684
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !	12.018472538408005
-- when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library .	222.07079269794758
no one made any reply .	2.0034987629320606
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said ,	22899.585705568617
by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?	44.642120371330655
-- i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure .	134536.32545354488
if you mean darcy cried her brother , he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins -- but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards .	341362.4529234839
i should like balls infinitely better she replied , if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	3483.870242675164
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day .	65.61450943472946
much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball .	173.11520741149215
miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	41.82841305023474
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; -- but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	353.59720934310246
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said ,	101.12810417968113
miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .	178.74419509830483
-- i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude .	15.294903623258294
elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	5.838908494428638
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr. darcy looked up .	66.15002069368869
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	473.7941762385827
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	37680.70099096779
what could he mean ?	1.840587295109467
she was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	181.8820685476178
not at all was her answer ; but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it .	4653.780180283754
miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	439.9786101828943
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	113.24294182800881
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; -- if the first , i should be completely in your way ; -- and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire .	35931428.32809239
oh !	1
shocking !	1
cried miss bingley .	1.4041923335261448
i never heard any thing so abominable .	4.348797865130718
how shall we punish him for such a speech ?	6.034954216755206
nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination said elizabeth .	18.877733342814576
we can all plague and punish one another .	3.937167662402456
teaze him -- laugh at him .	3.0292575221249614
-- intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done .	60.90088115411244
but upon my honour i do not .	2.940926775392492
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .	17.0481068149963
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	4.779014925438695
no , no -- i feel he may defy us there .	12.121464254928934
and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .	199.40574939418866
mr. darcy may hug himself .	1.9617159283253496
mr. darcy is not to be laughed at !	4.091280739771728
cried elizabeth .	1
that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .	932.8715012597121
i dearly love a laugh .	2.191933925741468
miss bingley said he , has given me credit for more than can be .	25.243778325058408
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	7110.448574895319
certainly replied elizabeth -- there are such people , but i hope i am not one of them .	127.78081222416058
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good .	8.60382558342057
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can .	91.17885664423451
-- but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without .	18.40814782988466
perhaps that is not possible for any one .	5.346385735556598
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .	134.08778471874166
such as vanity and pride .	2.0563387567662446
yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	3.720766423911017
but pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation .	66.33664560427974
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	4.30264075886409
your examination of mr. darcy is over , i presume said miss bingley ; -- and pray what is the result ?	165.92028646067297
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect .	16.152034840367858
he owns it himself without disguise .	2.4720516182231447
no -- said darcy , i have made no such pretension .	9.423787635237465
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding .	44.325933105892275
my temper i dare not vouch for .	3.832492753115739
-- it is i believe too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	54.7964816665041
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself .	73.93555623264929
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	9.521458253267332
my temper would perhaps be called resentful .	3.309171425066796
-- my good opinion once lost is lost for ever .	5.656981859052833
that is a failing indeed !	2.0097829384078274
-- cried elizabeth .	1.3506518423573746
implacable resentment is a shade in a character .	4.457940859011082
but you have chosen your fault well .	3.45197843082563
-- i really cannot laugh at it .	3.852638496098746
you are safe from me .	2.209134540885142
there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome .	968.3245502545559
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body .	6.482083906992533
and yours he replied with a smile , is wilfully to misunderstand them .	18.358898090185857
do let us have a little music -- cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .	145.44856377463404
-- louisa , you will not mind my waking mr. hurst .	8.894553505497047
her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	1300.038226654341
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .	15.165993580332035
chapter xii.	1
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	11718.969814067064
but mrs. bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	6411.196555420896
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	236.7398832509935
mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .	45022.52657546649
-- against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	25158952.670033146
the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	15768.081894911327
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	536.3995176549256
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	559758.28226261
to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence -- elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough .	28.182710457544275
she attracted him more than he liked -- and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself .	274.9313534980695
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	654449.7333968924
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	185128.754541864
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	116.78220289376092
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .	2798318.7796313344
-- elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	14.452198850108458
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	7.110761762528935
mrs. bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again .	858.5561884130857
-- but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle .	2355.633876848852
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth .	1983.6686809456573
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	5521.023907646722
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort .	16.631496576063235
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married .	300478.9669358213
chapter xiii.	1
i hope , my dear said mr. bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party .	38827.974938078296
who do you mean , my dear ?	3.3975923487026662
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope my dinners are good enough for her .	1465.45065121496
i do not believe she often sees such at home .	7.603246293771791
the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger .	33.28526160901672
mrs. bennet's eyes sparkled .	1.5883780770602303
-- a gentleman and a stranger !	3.521279056574296
it is mr. bingley i am sure .	3.6959221342903605
why jane -- you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing !	29.967169448429228
well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley .	33.756016747220315
-- but -- good lord !	1.6644222290508266
how unlucky !	1
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	11.601422718487672
lydia , my love , ring the bell .	5.282841783039348
i must speak to hill , this moment .	5.925501607304708
it is not mr. bingley said her husband ; it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life .	524.371185528526
this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	184.29956980217935
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	15.728187671314082
about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	3341.0780564243323
it is from my cousin , mr. collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases .	1274.4762001272197
oh !	1
my dear cried his wife , i cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	25.28684174132019
pray do not talk of that odious man .	5.1653021622757915
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it .	148218.42338419546
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	15.184830046857783
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	617120.8961402007
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr. bennet , and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn .	134.85979667348462
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself .	212.51427124128583
no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	2466.5692487613446
i hate such false friends .	1.850791736069593
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?	45.72241601449259
why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear .	182.95949885387043
hunsford , near westerham , kent ,	2.031342399966462
15th october .	1
dear sir ,	1
the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .	674474047.2666906
-- there , mrs. bennet .	2.1114904334676297
-- my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england .	11384025168.203411
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	204950264.32876363
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , -- but of this hereafter .	97268.26824772413
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	3316696755.1276946
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend ,	72.4104996375136
william collins.	1
at four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman said mr. bennet , as he folded up the letter .	81.79513419773137
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again .	27573.426800071476
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him .	4016.0769272236425
though it is difficult said jane , to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit .	3022.8578811576826
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	432.9909300121557
he must be an oddity , i think said she .	6.978325356560863
i cannot make him out .	2.3327934946901214
-- there is something very pompous in his style .	6.993852856730421
-- and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?	21.715900440003953
-- we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .	15.438152635847166
-- can he be a sensible man , sir ?	5.906855966386386
no , my dear ; i think not .	5.127967768020083
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	7.933716320037961
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	15.180334063461105
i am impatient to see him .	2.9701919259766143
in point of composition said mary , his letter does not seem defective .	16.141749627961502
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed .	80.76291206561314
to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	37.30457828133704
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	11008.38088359184
as for their mother , mr. collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	8620.364302088035
mr. collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	88.30613806458982
mr. bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr. collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	2030.2127701101203
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	13.492243259738592
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	17.954755059609017
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	14005812.517176364
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs. bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily ,	555.3622793878868
you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .	1519.629158656262
things are settled so oddly .	1.718581970474594
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	7.973616414414118
ah !	1
sir , i do indeed .	1.9668821632343612
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	14.328493466959818
not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world .	155.90844777662423
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	26.663865438137996
i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , -- and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	5880.808485121966
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them .	28.2848892456447
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted ----	53.082631621183
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .	37.5528709744407
they were not the only objects of mr. collins's admiration .	9.188178993127476
the hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs. bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	42052.9522010802
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	843.3257417194128
but here he was set right by mrs. bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	11633.558813056656
he begged pardon for having displeased her .	3.386458027097816
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	262.8059574080588
chapter xiv.	1
during dinner , mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	915979.8760809291
lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	62.18593940540478
mr. bennet could not have chosen better .	3.719817438265892
mr. collins was eloquent in her praise .	3.448854979820479
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine .	176683.52729844867
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	141.5862684898012
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	2744.719334297442
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .	235.45451886250663
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	602180.1472830465
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , -- some shelves in the closets up stairs .	4074389.171935094
that is all very proper and civil , i am sure said mrs. bennet , and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	469.9597156898876
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	31.803725800858867
does she live near you , sir ?	3.6448066089923197
the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship's residence .	169.7821960366417
i think you said she was a widow , sir ?	10.42620847932661
has she any family ?	1.5372014307606827
she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property .	28.682742704123832
ah !	1
cried mrs. bennet , shaking her head , then she is better off than many girls .	31.95291493263384
and what sort of young lady is she ?	4.195536561113409
is she handsome ?	1.2364992044419205
she is a most charming young lady indeed .	4.166667267565517
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	12888.633204410755
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	33094.9459200143
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .	140.24421369525433
has she been presented ?	1.8565544210273306
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court .	7.604089017523758
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament .	2735.242468625552
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	2533.342200941196
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .	7296.019792607068
-- these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay .	529.8499827136476
you judge very properly said mr. bennet , and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	172.49294463700429
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?	114.65322352151524
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .	36663.79181299707
mr. bennet's expectations were fully answered .	2.2464295951938746
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	93364.2337012193
by tea-time however the dose had been enough , and mr. bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	6222.56851869702
mr. collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library ,) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .	24073.96264879275
-- kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed .	5.480515682174928
-- other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce's sermons .	17.702243277693025
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with ,	464.1791207277434
do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him .	588.6818350993831
my aunt told me so herself on saturday .	6.396112394168572
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town .	174.14570278003444
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr. collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said ,	643.7059688019349
i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	202.9570301760284
it amazes me , i confess ; -- for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	191.29539281227318
but i will no longer importune my young cousin .	4.866208729546666
then turning to mr. bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	15.431615701469072
mr. bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	107.18093466256727
mrs. bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr. collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr. bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	41570049.08727791

mr. collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	6942215.124708984
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	200707.16871426575
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	67929197.15358894
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	626228.1278704196
this was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	13737.175155024632
his plan did not vary on seeing them .	5.029917642489719
-- miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice .	1794.5847567954013
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs. bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on .	63185692.32903569
-- as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not know of any prepossession ; -- her eldest daughter , she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .	1398901.526121363
mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire .	429.7105155235826
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	34.77530339370427
mrs. bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	30706.5034016819
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr. collins was to attend them , at the request of mr. bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr. collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr. bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford .	125658748217.09395
such doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly .	2.4873930838597387
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr. collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	44756165104.19138
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton .	208.19811049132838
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .	54.34293643363423
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	9522.778184699462
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	13593.245772114498
the officer was the very mr. denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	275.72467340642044
all were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	4747017.53277384
mr. denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr. wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	27141.785358900677
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	143.7089609537236
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	1500.2725354254676
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street .	1125159.0844982727
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	174.2372901980945
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object .	18.004732128853828
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	124.46427600849668
mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	1098428.9779668185
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	10.918566588509313
mr. wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return .	109.30263910341594
what could be the meaning of it ?	3.9107392351312114
-- it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .	30.21477010638996
in another minute mr. bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	177.98425022345796
mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr. philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs. philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	454732.41808500036
mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr. jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr. collins by jane's introduction of him .	3260364753508.023
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	881558.3950875906
mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr. denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ---- shire .	30432505.818742666
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr. wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become stupid , disagreeable fellows .	12218361.201184496
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr. wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening .	144264.1791873458
this was agreed to , and mrs. philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	932.8542984835618
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	33.55392042797257
mr. collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	50.38146523259182
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	113322.07035221216
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs. philips's manners and politeness .	32.17379852173006
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	437980.61182810226
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	2188.685967388479
chapter xvi.	1
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all mr. collins's scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	741277888.1856005
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr. collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	734531607082969.5
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs. philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	200794555.98103163
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	106384.23973393174
it was over at last however .	3.005161024069765
the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr. wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	19409.840982734604
the officers of the ---- shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	43606044.95363722
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	1022993441.5512835
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr. wickham and the officers , mr. collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	7775523.472064152
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	131.11557763014108
i know little of the game , at present said he , but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life ---- mrs. philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	110565.48636870671
mr. wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia .	221.43329702512466
at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	761817.5084953334
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy .	565007.4772842898
she dared not even mention that gentleman .	3.812699534350606
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	2.4778541724216754
mr. wickham began the subject himself .	3.4137220388773954
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there .	1492.5969754622313
about a month said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand .	2913.4954146213986
yes replied wickham ; -- his estate there is a noble one .	12.885495649463053
a clear ten thousand per annum .	2.0549938437192674
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy .	7134.905987818881
elizabeth could not but look surprised .	2.5721632997448864
you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .	1584.822098740709
-- are you much acquainted with mr. darcy ?	4.5367139582488605
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly , -- i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable .	2711.9246793831558
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham , as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	56.58431822369872
i am not qualified to form one .	2.834117379351174
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	27.717691351922806
it is impossible for me to be impartial .	5.086381801718394
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .	510.0311197028909
-- here you are in your own family .	6.536776360094504
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield .	236.55439398412045
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire .	4.053673189727765
every body is disgusted with his pride .	4.131128335286868
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one .	13.041770822841492
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham , after a short interruption , that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with him i believe it does not often happen .	14224.610536854692
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen .	1508.291626118447
i should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man .	45.26432239901978
wickham only shook his head .	1.839811334212557
i wonder said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , whether he is likely to be in this country much longer .	171.30147398377227
i do not at all know ; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .	111.28084390011583
i hope your plans in favour of the ---- shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood .	80.17860733569985
oh !	1
no -- it is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy .	20.983667738956257
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go .	9.688322854000361
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	896288.3598292577
his father , miss bennet , the late mr. darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	140768.61611568087
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .	3345.388620125625
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	398.31613866807174
mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	40854.35506455937
it was the prospect of constant society , and good society he added , which was my chief inducement to enter the ---- shire .	158.595221835687
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them .	14028.076174153091
society , i own , is necessary to me .	7.66125825780461
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	15.306015822624484
i must have employment and society .	2.3931809089695
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	112.03353759220823
the church ought to have been my profession -- i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .	106808.49735719057
indeed !	1
yes -- the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	50.51689850902275
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	6.568216292798405
i cannot do justice to his kindness .	3.602389632967513
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .	416.88243576146476
good heavens !	1
cried elizabeth ; but how could that be ?	5.62783677001104
-- how could his will be disregarded ?	3.7020374460706624
-- why did not you seek legal redress ?	3.127111959701702
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	76.68813220605247
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr. darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	265891.04655701155
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	2570292.0342925945
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .	416.04839647004127
i can recal nothing worse .	1.934736964753022
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .	85.12676131603243
this is quite shocking !	1.8169585323123243
-- he deserves to be publicly disgraced .	3.3113870029397297
some time or other he will be -- but it shall not be by me .	22.689450734348686
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose him .	21.018387816814688
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	58.15932258084372
but what said she , after a pause , can have been his motive ?	24.155212779926853
-- what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	6.546631527370986
a thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	142.4844233811041
had the late mr. darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life .	3155.75587026577
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me .	253.8821300558194
i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this -- though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him -- i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !	2802424.115278612
after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , i do remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	2109.953880922497
his disposition must be dreadful .	2.0680204580335717
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham , i can hardly be just to him .	66.72900321905091
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , to treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father !	4087.004416291218
-- she could have added , a young man too , like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable -- but she contented herself with and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner !	1064898.1313365374
we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	14718.881728485832
my father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr. philips , appears to do so much credit to -- but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr. darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property .	601153.6013011689
he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	20.610555220925967
mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself .	3233916.426571555
how strange !	1
cried elizabeth .	1
how abominable !	1
-- i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you !	108.55423940701371
-- if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , -- for dishonesty i must call it .	513.4672988393583
it is wonderful -- replied wickham , -- for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; -- and pride has often been his best friend .	1228.9370598319526
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	7.341876706620818
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride .	140.63239670531988
can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	15.255140431616384
yes .	1
it has often led him to be liberal and generous , -- to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	1332.6215806806106
family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	297.3554402783573
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive .	632.5545698722465
he has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .	16762.765529125172
what sort of a girl is miss darcy ?	5.7868827881443785
he shook his head .	1.5339279031758142
-- i wish i could call her amiable .	4.50113349913001
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy .	8.3130299555853
but she is too much like her brother , -- very , very proud .	31.180816316211086
-- as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	399.71174321740864
but she is nothing to me now .	4.665528795711483
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished .	32.741922835374936
since her father's death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education .	193.1545188645843
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying ,	301.6475421900402
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley !	8.56813334244901
how can mr. bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	1025.752829596981
how can they suit each other ?	2.6804231567079286
-- do you know mr. bingley ?	3.5838899833152076
not at all .	1.334967623386972
he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	6.52274620253896
he cannot know what mr. darcy is .	4.031357932418034
probably not ; -- but mr. darcy can please where he chuses .	14.438596410336515
he does not want abilities .	1.935927522122611
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	14.457562787860935
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	696.4050051464638
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , -- allowing something for fortune and figure .	2830.0042468142988
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. philips .	913.4032635538395
-- the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	19.69612670606723
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	2764918.6175431176
i know very well , madam said he , that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , -- and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	49890.56658390141
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters .	896.9598613573039
mr. wickham's attention was caught ; and after observing mr. collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh .	13591.965684825542
lady catherine de bourgh she replied , has very lately given him a living .	22.527238463854378
i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long .	298.9284112947527
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy .	659.3913331885839
no , indeed , i did not .	2.8224041842501557
-- i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections .	7.07707411595211
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday .	9.974509926273926
her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .	1143.6930966451614
this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley .	18.991169619334954
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	1553.3433333162302
mr. collins said she , speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .	150900.6828069607
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham ; i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	18619.05576633502
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .	2091967.5575707466
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickham's attentions .	10373.466835383068
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	335.71472629980076
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .	33.88103799247781
elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	8.415132670714568
she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent .	685959.8278008148
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr. collins , in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .	103964106.9582605
chapter xvii.	1
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr. wickham and herself .	62.761831972793786
jane listened with astonishment and concern ; -- she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingley's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .	653373.289407058
-- the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	1803143.3966403513
they have both said she , been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	468.39382550598583
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	5.288257621356733
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side .	522.2620596161494
very true , indeed ; -- and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?	3955.017227127014
-- do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody .	22.60362675922787
laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	61.163488745277114
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner , -- one , whom his father had promised to provide for .	15611.799293130613
-- it is impossible .	1.7318064758259475
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	197.32494688348538
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?	12.789242871586934
oh !	1
no .	1
i can much more easily believe mr. bingley's being imposed on , than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .	17090.203440835838
-- if it be not so , let mr. darcy contradict it .	17.07498331360312
besides , there was truth in his looks .	4.336322690955447
it is difficult indeed -- it is distressing .	4.923693704665008
-- one does not know what to think .	5.726887453799682
i beg your pardon ; -- one knows exactly what to think .	12.595056734567361
but jane could think with certainty on only one point , -- that mr. bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	4992.55288584902
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .	1921998.4996071665
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	6053.382328591473
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	2597.620618505933
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet's civilities .	2860.121982921296
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	49.97154121482807
mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	3412.286920671117
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy's looks and behaviour .	508006.39793759707
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	4112632.5910788756
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	16.926115742294876
while i can have my mornings to myself said she , it is enough .	22.17755262808258
-- i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .	12.893150196639366
society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body .	361.87975863508325
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .	27407565825.32752
i am by no means of opinion , i assure you said he , that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , -- a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .	3093638232254.8145
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	2.943331357934955
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances -- and to have mr. collins instead !	92.55381743697374
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	2.920457130474093
there was no help for it however .	3.69758383683902
mr. wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr. collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	815.6262005690269
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .	73.71237099315792
-- it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	20494.058322150056
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .	22342879.697428655
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	411.4571441694636
mr. collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	138.49979439744058
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .	6952519.727946215
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; -- the very shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy .	207.10000624997465
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .	447608.8766054179
chapter xviii.	1
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	4280.958025838513
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	140.29371903444886
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	48815.34749879084
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile ,	4131306123.5101123
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here .	565.0756048397177
this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .	68917417.89839129
-- attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .	15.557584972959129
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	11007.248465699353
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	195556902.53085837
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .	41.98413340829137
mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	9316.169145842317
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	6.108934990690558
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	323.9773299459005
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	1607131.514875974
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .	409.3050274147469
i dare say you will find him very agreeable .	8.750702036223231
heaven forbid !	1
-- that would be the greatest misfortune of all !	7.354135054355973
-- to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !	17.032052253793513
-- do not wish me such an evil .	5.154781168447224
when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	176427.8715614613
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	44025.452773577956
they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	7360060.6298306165
he replied , and was again silent .	3.482582692478218
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	20.865822370436348
it is your turn to say something now , mr. darcy .	11.34769777747147
-- i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples .	790.0023791736239
he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	50.09442786328624
very well .	1
-- that reply will do for the present .	6.129666197710505
-- perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .	32.19264303022374
-- but now we may be silent .	4.71168896244429
do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?	13.240967949812383
sometimes .	1
one must speak a little , you know .	6.915664486789359
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible .	12349.925946271936
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	148.16666760962678
both replied elizabeth archly ; for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .	91.23899662021421
-- we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb .	13310.280605428485
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure said he .	53.11839744049042
how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say .	13.408589651657222
-- you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly .	5.044931301440273
i must not decide on my own performance .	5.103061526884614
he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .	8149.799650468386
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance .	3690.1106573215934
the effect was immediate .	1.5148819620741119
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	1742.3507592311535
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said ,	9.174679273689078
mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends -- whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain .	1145.2576969850506
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis , and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life .	1813.554737185134
darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	9.312961206035801
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	122767.7380473733
i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .	8.749602800236964
such very superior dancing is not often seen .	5.424183871655701
it is evident that you belong to the first circles .	9.100547676562984
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley ,) shall take place .	239551.48757407875
what congratulations will then flow in !	2.5708822631956614
i appeal to mr. darcy -- but let me not interrupt you , sir .	23.168945931323588
-- you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me .	231.50696701457912
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .	56298.6279529509
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said ,	30.653577137123587
sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	15.61983419934155
i do not think we were speaking at all .	6.994784466594047
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .	56.144895348576604
-- we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine .	271.57030725663515
what think you of books ?	2.521425729104197
said he , smiling .	1.272580518302556
books -- oh !	1.0176351236453998
no .	1
-- i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings .	75.51062025936528
i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .	377.2565166251846
-- we may compare our different opinions .	2.941985580716203
no -- i cannot talk of books in a ball-room ; my head is always full of something else .	99.00841714621558
the present always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ?	8.379395114603879
said he , with a look of doubt .	4.549427050712367
yes , always she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	506635.46775805537
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created .	18.259740464294328
i am said he , with a firm voice .	4.365620853176237
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?	5.1431130504374725
i hope not .	1.236165065743072
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .	113.58916888146632
may i ask to what these questions tend ?	4.090905682422161
merely to the illustration of your character said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	20.67763688595427
i am trying to make it out .	4.246408877767191
and what is your success ?	2.2711657895307575
she shook her head .	1.5719897467161894
i do not get on at all .	3.1922681088700475
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly .	7.646429745717408
i can readily believe answered he gravely , that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either .	564564.1444478853
but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity .	34.72069391149434
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied .	9.686453756528735
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	1276916.9773153525
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her ,	101.13899864240602
so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !	20.72808671959755
-- your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy's steward .	206472.4829364446
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .	8444865.98260509
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	35906133.03349811
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .	344.65410952202456
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better .	693.797543705112
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily ; for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy's steward , and of that i can assure you , he informed me himself .	328559.436568287
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .	11.968514016215881
excuse my interference .	1.2240644683660886
-- it was kindly meant .	1.8517556611591963
insolent girl !	1
said elizabeth to herself .	1.8420325412235907
-- you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	87.25385529906326
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr. darcy .	36.80573084477421
she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .	61.90988832276793
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .	3646.7722736657647
-- elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	8455.979778836743
i want to know said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , what you have learnt about mr. wickham .	355.7205619916911
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon .	633.5367293345214
no replied jane , i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	50.03703196171842
mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	22500293982.831005
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy's regard .	58.63474920571909
mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ?	4.097787110820865
no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton .	21.085448799954133
this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .	14.00347146285618
i am perfectly satisfied .	2.058248634347299
but what does he say of the living ?	5.38756671165795
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only .	2159.926908734994
i have not a doubt of mr. bingley's sincerity said elizabeth warmly ; but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	294.0903940010932
mr. bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before .	276069.44143630663
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	210.94061982592132
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	1920.5547881524599
on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	2555167.1433667922
i have found out said he , by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	339.8829181626261
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .	6120.859153794372
how wonderfully these sort of things occur !	2.9553607417014534
who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !	158.9332030122933
-- i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	34649.16623488369
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology .	6.393055175712396
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy ?	7.61150693392506
indeed i am .	1.4167842052235093
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	9.848831509692026
i believe him to be lady catherine's nephew .	5.259244061676609
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night .	62.43615220909999
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .	292678999.90686756
-- mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus ,	305.8669150706723
my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	9110060688.483093
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .	1595.1713332847528
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself .	262527.68200098176
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	2377.689782545442
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh .	41149.53234245258
-- it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	18.207126690115082
mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	975.9640839021923
mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	22904.454611804536
mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .	3.1541548507023585
i have no reason , i assure you said he , to be dissatisfied with my reception .	26.885663116946535
mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	4.807468849670121
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	9403.356634902044
it was really a very handsome thought .	5.21274450510062
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him .	9.650448615899307
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .	200492.47064231161
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters .	21764.837359179575
her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	601.761057917786
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .	21942157.13443579
-- it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	114.38371110047761
his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	8483417.99772024
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	44427741.34096424
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	70731.36897749487
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	475.9358614773199
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .	394229.57859663124
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	4.052948346519344
what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?	48.87740933687166
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear .	273.01041255217245
for heaven's sake , madam , speak lower .	4.686779400172776
-- what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy ?	16.581439190485092
-- you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing .	16.848960278148265
nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	8.320815135740828
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	12.372511389905405
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	4.33242230700093
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	34010.82955506026
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	27.790933021074924
at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	38604.536587025425
elizabeth now began to revive .	2.0278414413247923
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	11835.862403894233
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , -- but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	38241.46159694175
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	25071392.376337465
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	76.34758620743575
-- elizabeth was in agonies .	2.2416980896685414
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .	165.152095687461
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	406.64534626917856
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .	44.73533690979512
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud ,	34.11878545652598
that will do extremely well , child .	4.204078962351143
you have delighted us long enough .	2.7458787001032046
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit .	6.908877686037901
mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .	2957.402593332158
-- others of the party were now applied to .	5.712247883641073
if i said mr. collins , were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	625730.7643214195
-- i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	3907.996289678697
the rector of a parish has much to do .	5.830541756877175
-- in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	501.5207215208564
he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	19372.204143274943
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	1063.6529126854757
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family .	3250.3194396640697
and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	637.9523054561255
-- many stared .	1.2097681398338993
-- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	245142.0525405964
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	6266087493.574798
that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	66394.38258279758
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	6.044592519350455
she was teazed by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	17439.031730249546
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	613.9037253387324
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	138687.3573138289
there was no arguing upon such a project .	3.547137934140839
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins's conversation to herself .	216.7182560550466
she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	6160.098773094164
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .	78.15293383766088
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	1662671.254354769
mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	333.5382627051289
they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	13747260.221801814
darcy said nothing at all .	2.080399558925064
mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	9.648166505613636
mr. bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	225.146050142885
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord , how tired i am !	3635.8713359475682
accompanied by a violent yawn .	2.2765538542614263
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	19504443.744932134
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	13880.340693455468
mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	58311.93484260586
of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	398.6295104435552
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .	12301.054544532133
chapter xix.	1
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .	5.331070103073012
mr. collins made his declaration in form .	3.0471541925304684
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	8095381.647780307
on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words ,	855.7131579399908
may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?	3038.417468228733
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs. bennet instantly answered ,	59.12680121913672
oh dear !	1
-- yes -- certainly .	1.8633640105658789
-- i am sure lizzy will be very happy -- i am sure she can have no objection .	82.78798173978892
-- come , kitty , i want you up stairs .	9.32201696204915
and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out ,	27.524725970886
dear ma'am , do not go .	3.095389203754353
-- i beg you will not go .	4.057667964005892
-- mr. collins must excuse me .	2.9807035523373924
-- he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	54.71560530847152
i am going away myself .	2.218753218564574
no , no , nonsense , lizzy .	4.940198067493949
-- i desire you will stay where you are .	4.706479718257953
-- and upon elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing mr. collins .	1313.9058163541554
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	611106.193740331
mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr. collins began .	43.98356016363997
believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .	343.27987550238623
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address .	3272.587151731563
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	694.8648820813173
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life .	36.95858667741595
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did .	97766.95718299162
the idea of mr. collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued	63177.10271230679
my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	5261.120392675675
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .	97600.13422406645
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too !	11.146004287451802
) on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while mrs. jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'mr. collins , you must marry .	21840.712773128696
a clergyman like you must marry .	2.732060112549858
-- chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ; and for your own let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .	33207.829177354855
this is my advice .	1.6706849246838051
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her .'	200.18881478595952
allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	18055.703730032652
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	10655.212669472163
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .	12575.413686194383
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer ,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years .	2444409882.9887342
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	155.6093846747932
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	112.24744605038217
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	31648.8562781358
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	121.22155501421967
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .	723.8372831872425
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	4.18052429289642
you are too hasty , sir she cried .	4.804587114429605
you forget that i have made no answer .	5.219017401080837
let me do it without farther loss of time .	6.606703052629761
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	7.997667915502928
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them .	177.97705741011117
i am not now to learn replied mr. collins , with a formal wave of the hand , that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	2789954.2710481095
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .	165.37731984112733
upon my word , sir cried elizabeth , your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	58.026096403256155
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	13335.01476687135
i am perfectly serious in my refusal .	4.109183942360218
-- you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so .	365.51826936800796
-- nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .	951.9017294059761
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr. collins very gravely -- but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	1247.5734995481564
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications .	2610.949672047279
indeed , mr. collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	14.53015724930146
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .	66.3590834228231
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	484.71636439404523
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	5525.096164498729
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled .	7.513702759805319
and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr. collins thus addressed her ,	118.0485489203439
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .	11429774508.799393
really , mr. collins cried elizabeth with some warmth , you puzzle me exceedingly .	16.616600724468988
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	6260.302809689521
you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	186.10335274332905
my reasons for believing it are briefly these -- it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	12001.128899210755
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	1400624.8193204342
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	115.8242744411151
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	15687.308435577952
i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	229.24941297096217
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	11.177988410956136
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	311.0303156831686
my feelings in every respect forbid it .	3.4939019280930945
can i speak plainer ?	1.550968829449684
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	525.8524837303203
you are uniformly charming !	1.4841480765476964
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .	7930.372379114278
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	31122868.954741657
chapter xx.	1
mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	89070942.18430838
mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	6044976.1992386505
this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; -- she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	138324.09058364338
but depend upon it , mr. collins she added , that lizzy shall be brought to reason .	42.782969967452665
i will speak to her about it myself directly .	6.967299536274895
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it .	192.89531471305997
pardon me for interrupting you , madam cried mr. collins ; but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	474735.3103576974
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .	16243.118712298685
sir , you quite misunderstand me said mrs. bennet , alarmed .	9.940169265772848
lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	5.465449412342602
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	41.62895394587615
i will go directly to mr. bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure .	208.38054757810048
she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library ,	328.0903131156884
oh !	1
mr. bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .	26.2821343791803
you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .	5928.85715854398
mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	4512.854026787392
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he , when she had finished her speech .	46.80632467994064
of what are you talking ?	2.330876764765794
of mr. collins and lizzy .	2.0595869943185523
lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins , and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy .	200.83468881566841
and what am i to do on the occasion ?	6.48823790750401
-- it seems an hopeless business .	2.572567377052348
speak to lizzy about it yourself .	3.0115122404288153
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him .	4.995388192522692
let her be called down .	2.380569900340076
she shall hear my opinion .	2.3106450885393053
mrs. bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .	24.46066834267026
come here , child cried her father as she appeared .	8.895561803370171
i have sent for you on an affair of importance .	8.041371120808432
i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage .	16.281529945908055
is it true ?	1.2345787291861576
elizabeth replied that it was .	1.9532289102042388
very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ?	8.950246185424229
i have , sir .	2.0448479224019858
very well .	1
we now come to the point .	3.6774787966910103
your mother insists upon your accepting it .	2.7886164638650044
is not it so , mrs. bennet ?	4.003721982555935
yes , or i will never see her again .	9.528512709049997
an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .	4.928721767928515
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .	16.15103322546439
-- your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you do .	273.92168557684687
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	4135.3031191706195
what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?	27.870939955451174
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him .	4.347410632752219
my dear replied her husband , i have two small favours to request .	15.890697377628008
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .	365.1053341970432
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be .	22.73620501906124
not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point .	97.42960872886205
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .	17.540981745152575
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; -- and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	3392.0432577344072
though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	6.774226631670322
mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	9.838575816703058
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	1871.8061993183205
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	109.71761885642678
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .	87.04364028721865
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !	4141.716033712062
-- what do you think has happened this morning ?	5.499255291381239
-- mr. collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him .	75.14094296910616
charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where mrs. bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	150455881.80680206
pray do , my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone , for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves .	10402.954909193626
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .	9.187923034874643
aye , there she comes continued mrs. bennet , looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .	5732.009777558537
-- but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .	2085002.5507464644
-- i shall not be able to keep you -- and so i warn you .	30.14180947169119
-- i have done with you from this very day .	12.930243702179856
-- i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	3504.434541342249
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .	5.405137078250942
-- not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .	19.76945870696178
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	32.96585973110089
nobody can tell what i suffer !	3.7150243817351525
-- but it is always so .	3.1094136873720513
those who do not complain are never pitied .	4.301029267834574
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	173.45904149952617
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls ,	30722.145000154287
now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together .	1756.3285382761326
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	92299037.7728602
in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected conversation .	7.192292553276337
-- oh !	1
mr. collins !	1
--	1
my dear madam replied he , let us be for ever silent on this point .	52.26769154624102
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	253.15637805985614
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .	8393.179078374227
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	410791.5015393623
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	228887.66924468527
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	78.903763687848
but we are all liable to error .	3.3829647445443207
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	7.1448456752439355
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise .	13045.092357193838
chapter xxi.	1
the discussion of mr. collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	7562.533264698367
as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	3638.873648155356
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	253209.6435166132
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet's ill humour or ill health .	13.054788005742324
mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	7.861062396307126
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	260.59083291111165
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .	60.471251780384854
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball .	982.2026851479598
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .	2441.8203032288206
-- to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .	57.65694070932741
i found said he , as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; -- that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .	3865376.9891040623
she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	910905.8843437477
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	2834.0483721909586
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .	163.25722053989992
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	64021.58254518362
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	11153192.769661557
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said ,	31.51565006350253
this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	40.29559238254012
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .	528.8738952013236
you shall hear what she says .	3.2846006022820173
she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr. hurst had a house .	76683.38718346258
the next was in these words .	3.756531296692291
i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	11918179.796153579
i depend on you for that .	3.6569458612468346
to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	184590886.4966605
it is unlucky said she , after a short pause , that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	620.0384388855624
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?	117509.91424333665
-- mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them .	10.012078854057167
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter .	16.813144020013223
i will read it to you --	4.001709998517172
when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	1848591884.1925764
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .	31288.533100590863
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	22704.897385406966
it is evident by this added jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	35.85164522179865
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should .	14.745133612127004
why will you think so ?	2.804148809538886
it must be his own doing .	3.071804051578583
-- he is his own master .	3.0525947167552396
but you do not know all .	2.301193466288138
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	6.753144403155301
i will have no reserves from you .	4.219652158733026
mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	342.97794684283565
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	169269.2446404965
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	7562.657631338737
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	886263.3093045186
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?	11566.19843924755
what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy ?	8.036866257316362
-- said jane as she finished it .	3.8640730643638745
is it not clear enough ?	2.122935885886813
-- does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly !	107229.88295194833
) to put me on my guard ?	3.9732778001101394
can there be any other opinion on the subject ?	6.64105233854351
yes , there can ; for mine is totally different .	8.588149760243127
-- will you hear it ?	2.366345222086859
most willingly .	1
you shall have it in few words .	4.124807622829913
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .	101.47350818952566
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .	298.4711338679221
jane shook her head .	1.5719897467161894
indeed , jane , you ought to believe me .	8.111478274722847
-- no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	27.63229354299148
miss bingley i am sure cannot .	1.8992628820929864
she is not such a simpleton .	2.472211716152813
could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	256.2553703315431
but the case is this .	2.6089709720162912
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .	58562794.41393879
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .	338299774.1455726
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane , your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	179.0702529937842
but i know the foundation is unjust .	3.519811225986981
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself .	293.7930713400158
that is right .	1.3084556997893948
-- you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .	62.21693020740194
believe her to be deceived by all means .	4.285906296132122
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer .	19.02168241796954
but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?	3000.625208302057
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth , and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him .	44998.77099439719
how can you talk so ?	2.317812800708021
-- said jane faintly smiling , -- you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate .	380.46048774780195
i did not think you would ; -- and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion .	204.66509235268958
but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	29.06302679605352
a thousand things may arise in six months !	3.995691526362576
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	15.945422062973627
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	7402.707110718491
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	512.2372631247034
jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	10793.869410662428
they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	4251030.1515321145
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	6333950.433510426
chapter xxii.	1
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins .	2328.649194215152
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	2.216150847096192
it keeps him in good humour said she , and i am more obliged to you than i can express .	67.29381577311183
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	423.91599491892447
this was very amiable , but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; -- its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr. collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	40629.36234428357
such was miss lucas's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .	15145.833421915591
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .	37835.51815337651
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .	121844769.13996133
his reception however was of the most flattering kind .	6.08316244901414
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	901.6957002155362
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	41.63793413988827
in as short a time as mr. collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	155622156.9927074
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	532067.0084577075
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	135.57544609533875
mr. collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	2612.0094459984407
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st .	23522878.883634236
james's .	1
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	10.39651978547117
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid .	2806.6216248770115
charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	1.8317237690612176
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	18.448139909270026
her reflections were in general satisfactory .	2.991339819235768
mr. collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	305.97772016524857
but still he would be her husband .	4.796516251007677
-- without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	55072.62873672553
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	884.849301849121
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	1886.7532677769411
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	511.5620592186466
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	12504.200713236147
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	8154931.79507531
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	25592209.870508756
my dear madam he replied , this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	31791.903086619717
they were all astonished ; and mr. bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said ,	121.05226070820137
but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ?	23.19555951262595
-- you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness .	32.43863530277686
my dear sir replied mr. collins , i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence .	3607.8108666440303
you cannot be too much on your guard .	5.186748214994119
risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence .	131634.5503917312
believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .	290464.03786212247
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth .	10880.397558885566
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	105.9425090661865
mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	1830.2918058219138
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	1205188.9239995766
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	41.80195246800186
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .	277.12603561833527
the possibility of mr. collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out ,	36352623.48211983
engaged to mr. collins !	1.7386243824775454
my dear charlotte , -- impossible !	3.7011862005255782
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied ,	149836.48761371092
why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?	6.055332090335631
-- do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?	1053.9352200129442
but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	41299.619397954404
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte , -- you must be surprised , very much surprised , -- so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you .	2504.788431822539
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .	572.8820460106102
i am not romantic you know .	2.126972749883274
i never was .	1.2372903250313874
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr. collins's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state .	37725.75774503799
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly -- and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	131.47406416993508
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	153.74859275647842
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	75.08090853220925
the strangeness of mr. collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	244.1386914183101
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	17061.056144288796
charlotte the wife of mr. collins , was a most humiliating picture !	13.495723805238129
-- and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	18256.245802563986
chapter xxiii.	1
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	78514.2725035142
with many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , -- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed ,	6036444.399239983
good lord !	1
sir william , how can you tell such a story ?	7.755929353236939
-- do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ?	17.5537353532026
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	588028.4015086787
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .	200421415072.8333
mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	1880.9760996975588
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	322320.9273379583
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	497744.44440966984
nothing could console and nothing appease her .	2.93431349617278
-- nor did that day wear out her resentment .	5.654551590519954
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	35855.90667692064
mr. bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	32943220.797315154
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	11054.633177610192
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .	9587.80097361894
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	1255768.5082694215
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	1013.5480220158718
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	1801985.2463931516
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	216.05132028968248
the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	3860.2419023126913
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	126571693083947.6
mr. collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .	33.81420075038444
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .	36.361959213729584
-- it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .	249.401318227716
-- she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	235.3206382491993
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley's continued absence .	199.3205754012156
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	5.436007879964782
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	478617.99517818773
even elizabeth began to fear -- not that bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	341.9614016056337
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	723.2647477119386
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	25390.409579979012
as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	43604.66555568846
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	357042.1273639626
it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	11.440162375745865
mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	1332.9441129734557
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	1757.0622940388196
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	14150.568538771266
mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	5.998755456804847
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	1438.2943201854607
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .	7.172744804846703
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	14.642067907833281
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr. bennet were dead .	4069180.3238227684
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	6.567338138705749
indeed , mr. bennet said she , it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it !	117967.41942403487
my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	7.236351677217345
let us hope for better things .	2.681943243338569
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor .	8.272268912150404
this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before ,	214.15772133294976
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	19.552603982141882
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it .	17.638441714532448
what should not you mind ?	2.4734871779305956
i should not mind any thing at all .	4.460377773500143
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	26.903237091629133
i never can be thankful , mr. bennet , for any thing about the entail .	44.20767891920804
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr. collins too !	938.8915316168851
-- why should he have it more than anybody else ?	10.112114619585915
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr. bennet .	8.915329069652815

chapter i.	1
miss bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	7.670017556223945
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country .	104922.77480881658
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	11344.668702563808
miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	3.659874319875312
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	1807.6300430777706
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of mr. darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	2619.9577286288527
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	74.61324100036032
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	49.313411771319494
to caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .	27.80314885807321
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	515579273.04834235
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	71686.49973055112
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	131.3974468907065
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	76449379.09492262
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs. bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying ,	97132.7008750655
oh !	1
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	782.5983077364848
but i will not repine .	1.9874385268822763
it cannot last long .	1.5133361735274067
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .	31.539597530976792
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	13.9149136241596
you doubt me cried jane , slightly colouring ; indeed you have no reason .	26.725099323748655
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	137.81581161825665
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	33.071139194141786
thank god !	1
i have not that pain .	1.9593128317000077
a little time therefore .	1.6575608285021526
-- i shall certainly try to get the better .	6.631506148753927
with a stronger voice she soon added , i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself .	67395.80305757342
my dear jane !	1.3372545202255135
exclaimed elizabeth , you are too good .	4.421097772938074
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you .	67.1315558076071
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve .	52.8095303262737
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	47.04900176254802
nay said elizabeth , this is not fair .	5.326254229362439
you wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body .	113.200057269444
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .	20.468827599358665
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	109.43349474804036
you need not .	1.3111164882765014
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well .	74.36639944853171
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	88547.6486467354
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte's marriage .	101.43949065230177
it is unaccountable !	1.0368959072618449
in every view it is unaccountable !	2.3724534702524775
my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	15.873675701880154
they will ruin your happiness .	1.8246255900883723
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	11.67229957357492
consider mr. collins's respectability , and charlotte's prudent , steady character .	8.429066174603197
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .	154972.55818683558
to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart .	2665416.651110814
my dear jane , mr. collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	523215.0299950697
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas .	13.684916483506884
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	9676.328574225103
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane , and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	1078.2018382446286
but enough of this .	1.9438816881351328
you alluded to something else .	1.9447849523342498
you mentioned two instances .	1.6288135245996658
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	3251.149417244392
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	7.193977001828676
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	40.80867717878426
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	10.77618031030655
women fancy admiration means more than it does .	5.055719409698642
and men take care that they should .	3.8013101061889203
if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .	996.1788730116282
i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley's conduct to design said elizabeth ; but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	8857.48303630171
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business .	131.15595718763404
and do you impute it to either of those ?	7.030873223444568
yes ; to the last .	2.542981469855695
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem .	87.19823732814216
stop me whilst you can .	2.097399470500094
you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him .	10.454971409288978
yes , in conjunction with his friend .	3.172763749444988
i cannot believe it .	2.0008426845872433
why should they try to influence him ?	4.129076809985291
they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it .	160.133451064332
your first position is false .	1.6934228292878193
they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride .	33668.862035119535
beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane ; but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	715.9775955910087
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .	124.53088639572562
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	100.58601005629185
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	67.16557977076002
if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .	565.5558265054451
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	93.56283382235566
do not distress me by the idea .	4.177296083454694
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	9104.606370647565
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood .	69.3428760709381
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr. bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	191.53546159102973
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	23303.25243978657
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	7583695.310245039
mrs. bennet's best comfort was , that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer .	45.07273013571005
mr. bennet treated the matter differently .	2.716914296404714
so , lizzy said he one day , your sister is crossed in love i find .	51.82626399470014
i congratulate her .	1.2303378254615047
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	65.14801132221011
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	47.579512613308225
when is your turn to come ?	3.194454816922579
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane .	8.45002767034907
now is your time .	1.9371313848186107
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	29.43055401360929
let wickham be your man .	2.032212872143099
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably .	6.944765797618501
thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	27.7478976175072
we must not all expect jane's good fortune .	4.950249081579685
true said mr. bennet , but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .	8815.847407662493
mr. wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family .	330.37007114195103
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	51.00695966038621
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr. darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	3418603.6750756926
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes -- but by everybody else mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	609631.9416889979
chapter ii.	1
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr. collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday .	455.36456115297455
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	384836.6322592466
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	2001.1443309957597
on the following monday , mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn .	913.1388503659988
mr. gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	171.13192085402255
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	6360.926743478827
mrs. gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs. bennet and mrs. philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces .	4564.071304088477
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	23.823426976931113
they had frequently been staying with her in town .	7.12136543282893
the first part of mrs. gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	95.00978024392143
when this was done , she had a less active part to play .	19.608129379016464
it became her turn to listen .	3.373076302253686
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	17.68906363619754
they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	13.211070730756074
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	258.841153582828
i do not blame jane she continued , for jane would have got mr. bingley , if she could .	100.27415547036377
but , lizzy !	1.3932862967448156
oh , sister !	1.3805992061396704
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr. collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	617.1375736484906
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	17.605008136813126
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	2947.1414214196816
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .	4.9228475418179265
they are all for what they can get .	6.879687207793905
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	36.6705782529614
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	608.1302865057099
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	2119.6258685131133
mrs. gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	16442.734583399797
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	16.1695457159762
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she .	17.030231625731037
i am sorry it went off .	1.990717599812521
but these things happen so often !	2.837541051839493
a young man , such as you describe mr. bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent .	38548.38821759191
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth , but it will not do for us .	43.99000724774365
we do not suffer by accident .	2.5115810215870393
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .	22773.975510192202
but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	150.06772449482798
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	137.69074634687226
pray , how violent was mr. bingley's love ?	4.971617899677583
i never saw a more promising inclination .	3.4845728427872524
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	15.948272515639296
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	10.503769866140411
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	1590.6703750007168
could there be finer symptoms ?	2.021184449412921
is not general incivility the very essence of love ?	5.0166257843073065
oh , yes !	1.3053693132800441
-- of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt .	30.748424075064584
poor jane !	1
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	146.63152094614435
it had better have happened to you lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	88.68209371241927
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	23.817775722934343
change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	203.12197460303543
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	36.378076130414755
i hope added mrs. gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	46.86761863927039
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .	277949.5375667877
and that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london !	10608.871083946911
my dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	9.44550021194334
mr. darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr. bingley never stirs without him .	49205.35705672041
so much the better .	1.4889221140597033
i hope they will not meet at all .	5.580550852359575
but does not jane correspond with the sister ?	4.901161931072144
she will not be able to help calling .	3.140575703008702
she will drop the acquaintance entirely .	2.565481503408706
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	450673.4480687533
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions .	3805.0946974438534
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	2053080.8237480195
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	1133.2584758454486
mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	745.8261249116478
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs. gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	105551.28580038282
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	3375846.922353595
to mrs. gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	47.517702832812056
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged .	2599.9913354352516
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	1066375.1717013484
mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr. darcy by character perfectly well .	35.982429559166256
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	4.159034269628194
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	5034.525315009287
on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	991136.9364131346
chapter iii.	1
mrs. gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on	2748.2551827730936
you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .	1314.2834652615354
seriously , i would have you be on your guard .	10.416741126654406
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	214.9934317492158
i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better .	4559.661891514998
but as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you .	34.385398460645916
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	15.18622232572555
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure .	29.353929146131534
you must not disappoint your father .	2.51580514007852
my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed .	4.425436001260407
yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise .	15.521213710569242
well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	11.401824739177712
i will take care of myself , and of mr. wickham too .	18.35758492251018
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it .	18.925839898893866
elizabeth , you are not serious now .	4.438227623200385
i beg your pardon .	1.3982928913489159
i will try again .	1.7350288598969141
at present i am not in love with mr. wickham ; no , i certainly am not .	81.88250400082569
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- i believe it will be better that he should not .	8233.751320384246
i see the imprudence of it .	2.7222653155771246
-- oh !	1
that abominable mr. darcy !	1.652980511482166
-- my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it .	81.39575323217042
my father , however , is partial to mr. wickham .	6.066691421747366
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	3786065345.011899
all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	26.475694887893056
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	27.81392441595439
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .	20.766072757251383
in short , i will do my best .	5.1125831833985815
perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	47.324753156185245
at least , you should not remind your mother of inviting him .	13.39375198653016
as i did the other day said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .	571.3579606639425
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .	15.01144088259877
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	27.871053223043443
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	23.095384643366433
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied .	2094.6170784069845
her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	12686.809933439441
mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet .	24481.10110817177
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she wished they might be happy .	14774.948882338456
thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	135824.3351523426
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said ,	10.225395954333688
i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza .	15.535360367338576
that you certainly shall .	1.829008286013072
and i have another favour to ask .	3.3884761598112783
will you come and see me ?	3.4870492898544563
we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire .	11.82771147866729
i am not likely to leave kent for some time .	6.14263466937458
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford .	6.06685281506741
elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	11.936709232108923
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte , and i hope you will consent to be of the party .	474.9999169213821
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them .	30.2801370231752
the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	5875.518397935926
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	1790.2068608248392
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	18325.91996870477
charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	378313692.6209402
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	24.050337642427035
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	454.4845766458544
it was mr. collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	1675.2845973972355
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys .	22220.643566748106
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	25.47022049991241
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline .	32.4198902469051
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	562.8348352266918
my aunt she continued , is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street .	237.95003201435264
she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley .	33.21475807072706
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words , but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london .	6850.224574891657
i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .	21.16579050296252
i enquired after their brother , of course .	6.77310784642186
he was well , but so much engaged with mr. darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	119.47937167308999
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner .	9.165504131148868
i wish i could see her .	3.3121272009013496
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out .	30.81080908973312
i dare say i shall soon see them here .	7.433013320221875
elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	3.4210217222958224
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister's being in town .	40.98073524412826
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him .	12.310999483297653
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention .	224.99923083469454
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer .	579414.3532849309
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	81.0272609191375
my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me .	13140.518839767083
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	17227.05782697497
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again .	3148.2908894107804
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time .	785.4223368727911
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	95167819.29086636
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her .	7.05966477839247
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	584.582562660569
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	5936.766358198696
i need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	4218980.656999935
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	7369.892616662145
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy .	119872.69664430697
i cannot understand it .	1.915770585525153
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	694.5536385095954
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	2843.8342591654423
let me hear from you very soon .	4.560005806824697
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	357.7666009765859
we had better not mention it .	3.9162730613180345
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .	25.994820924303124
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria .	15.031396752760978
i am sure you will be very comfortable there .	5.982582738613702
your's , &c .	1.0024385476315292
this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	806.3807103042542
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	7.733712720109966
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	9.73498706640536
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr. darcy's sister , as , by wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	374883.0727718124
mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	4095.971431795742
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	83.3870551349783
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	218.03353900406722
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	704.6037885772398
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	246893.95882197047
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	149126.76874185036
all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on -- i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	9055101.201741304
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king .	33.191827027140434
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .	1190.9949650897804
there can be no love in all this .	6.317209027282915
my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance .	9735.751035515417
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	2.938733239003058
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do .	17.217151347224497
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain .	5992.958853199335
chapter iv.	1
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away .	2151.2786319418833
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford .	4.493411266793363
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	20816.178178076356
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr. collins .	29.368643526451727
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	3969.7513415760454
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	1996.512748929818
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch .	27.35295231283626
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter .	10.00827668191908
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	195.42778153144027
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	268052.8004700468
the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .	43.36813693774003
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	381143467533598.94
her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	66.0443405194277
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	101819.1625910259
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william's too long .	11.841458659035045
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information .	223.60607039076555
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch-street by noon .	106.97997437974308
as they drove to mr. gardiner's door , jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	222498.33106933627
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	166975.60982384472
all was joy and kindness .	2.0409701583411093
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	109.0622580414347
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	5.394270096705764
their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	18688.306611528933
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .	27.985825231108077
mrs. gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	78142.7962372843
mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	42.60733659080984
but , my dear elizabeth she added , what sort of girl is miss king ?	20.97496952542915
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary .	7.5133307545975585
pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	75.37187089815677
where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	3.62366491564225
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .	65094.54230147441
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think .	121.80636036641059
she is a very good kind of girl , i believe .	13.30928159669769
i know no harm of her .	2.664250910069612
but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune .	87.40818269007045
no -- why should he ?	2.3041566284732085
if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?	19104.810086411442
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event .	37.76130867592534
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	64.31686105328247
if she does not object to it , why should we ?	7.716398382119311
her not objecting , does not justify him .	3.7720037122092585
it only shews her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling .	11.52257293002199
well cried elizabeth , have it as you choose .	6.774208844037719
he shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .	7.681135579204838
no , lizzy , that is what i do not choose .	9.715985829242802
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire .	301.51950588590825
oh !	1
if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better .	2492.4356112343316
i am sick of them all .	3.0733386471758717
thank heaven !	1
i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	686.0155719032325
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all .	13.06039737448246
take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment .	9.17552709395095
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	6871.219143777073
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs. gardiner , but perhaps to the lakes .	162.13920787422347
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	186.83509477028946
my dear , dear aunt she rapturously cried , what delight !	11.512097053005286
what felicity !	1
you give me fresh life and vigour .	3.0057289795149105
adieu to disappointment and spleen .	1.7084498936360748
what are men to rocks and mountains ?	2.520065796435886
oh !	1
what hours of transport we shall spend !	3.3194290801349697
and when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	396.7200278800939
we will know where we have gone -- we will recollect what we have seen .	44.79520379873009
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	2465.2280336062486
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers .	13.493621655383288
chapter v.	1
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	1237669.2560353365
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	2478.8726047125956
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side .	8.521123819670736
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	24.780333697197953
at length the parsonage was discernible .	2.8033662822825027
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	389.6726787726035
mr. collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	12403.294316253428
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	52.76452015799773
mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	832.840994968049
she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	74777.55016310785
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	1027047.6475024241
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	538290.9358597953
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	26541.26648317168
when mr. collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .	1164.9087987187343
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear .	57.286444648046654
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	7463608.751742915
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	17794.141582968474
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .	7144.314485430756
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	134.0864483095637
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	243874.7106928051
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	9.233742524102386
from his garden , mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	15424275.04014065
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit .	1921.9357768552293
when mr. collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	1856.3728796283842
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country .	16.403150341456072
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr. collins joining in , observed ,	66.61582894994979
yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her .	2234.3802487938924
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .	383.4193260640867
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	935.7337982186903
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .	6.286087068715841
we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	30.959352763895723
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	4.114194937490409
i should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several .	27.792490629160568
lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed added charlotte , and a most attentive neighbour .	59.574161933122454
very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say .	14.21943055355607
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	17.825421626996462
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	8528690.135535605
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr. collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings .	2132.472519444186
a lively imagination soon settled it all .	3.719605879073564
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	1044492.4109511166
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out ,	125.75070643243853
oh , my dear eliza !	1.9394219257747758
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	91.81495092356222
i will not tell you what it is .	6.123220063562125
make haste , and come down this moment .	6.425147359765195
elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	84195.07848701207
and is this all ?	1.7271398973815912
cried elizabeth .	1
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter !	235.6653349373886
la !	1
my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake , it is not lady catherine .	23.736124359354868
the old lady is mrs. jenkinson , who lives with them .	14.64957961115255
the other is miss de bourgh .	2.5994988373271894
only look at her .	1.965437404592727
she is quite a little creature .	3.353665733891548
who would have thought she could be so thin and small !	13.25695233019196
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	18.277482487876973
why does she not come in ?	3.549332218336061
oh !	1
charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	4.309736668302713
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in .	8.49848070006373
i like her appearance said elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	7.845966364483106
she looks sickly and cross .	1.961920410345042
-- yes , she will do for him very well .	13.765894265933508
she will make him a very proper wife .	5.8720294644090965
mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .	192301.1149837536
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	230.99565522897018
mr. collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day .	27280.31747484255
chapter vi.	1
mr. collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	7.538570531381726
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	5242350.3386288695
i confess said he , that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings .	2252.5200708356856
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	35.3282084872208
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	10.6557259175193
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !	609.6506955166168
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william , from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	7899.314688191429
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon .	10.96245064959512
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings .	121.56785366737142
mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	2348.1625113350033
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth ,	18.417405095362778
do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	15.648371792197125
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	53.222960119873825
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	777.688361676913
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	19.07763851168822
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .	5.807601509683145
while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .	4877.383994295676
-- such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st .	353243.91937940614
james's .	1
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .	128.94906440424552
-- every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .	17798699.067953892
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm .	270.8761592199877
-- elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	3.060531703730949
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	2153.399425436804
from the entrance hall , of which mr. collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs. jenkinson were sitting .	59966.525130743066
-- her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	860353.1987006463
in spite of having been at st .	3.3179079366855073
james's , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	6664882.663387816
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .	67.70481231068737
-- lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	119.39666391345622
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	448.156005242129
she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	1098212.8489345182
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	261441.25327119007
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	17.857790011443775
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs. jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	15899938.405016126
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	167831.0846201192
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .	7406879.905143408
-- he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear .	262227.5608083155
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	848.1425097351126
the party did not supply much conversation .	3.297974590881183
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	61882.12028411939
mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	438.1810673235868
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	45.194643198966965
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	883207.385158482
she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	1167900.0726754747
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	230.37444743249904
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs. collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs. collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	696726.6225253945
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name ?	2902353.1088757175
-- elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .	24.07142106576114
-- lady catherine then observed ,	2.273276358810582
your father's estate is entailed on mr. collins , i think .	12.352601541833971
for your sake turning to charlotte , i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .	325.26163273794157
-- it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family .	9.815099920515332
-- do you play and sing , miss bennet ?	6.338706552076992
a little .	1
oh !	1
then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	19.90350688686138
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day .	41.90764332918632
-- do your sisters play and sing ?	3.306073433537108
one of them does .	1.514075085890984
why did not you all learn ?	2.7302842843663035
-- you ought all to have learned .	4.009154096013535
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's .	44.86173979173619
-- do you draw ?	1.5966941130820431
no , not at all .	2.097940732737264
what , none of you ?	2.4601166754690023
not one .	1
that is very strange .	1.7349487580328384
but i suppose you had no opportunity .	5.4236332669586025
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters .	29.33060341992559
my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london .	27.745678449655824
has your governess left you ?	2.0288612843779252
we never had any governess .	2.3777965829021
no governess !	1
how was that possible ?	1.718922551781607
five daughters brought up at home without a governess !	7.194142593992003
-- i never heard of such a thing .	5.651105823120939
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .	8.298702309490528
elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	46.444431417246825
then , who taught you ?	2.104181549395536
who attended to you ?	1.9613063210544754
without a governess you must have been neglected .	4.582323312624588
compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	295.29351218592507
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	24.698212371023086
those who chose to be idle , certainly might .	5.697261516675733
aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	3397.1520195870744
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	468.3951464044256
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way .	29.808692878727225
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	12.531065798693646
four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	48646.32859046077
mrs. collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	26.548440632220213
she finds miss pope a treasure .	2.227847520755464
'lady catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .'	14.739251583080787
are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ?	10.072802186532783
yes , ma'am , all .	2.05509572773708
all !	1
-- what , all five out at once ?	5.165726219062556
very odd !	1
-- and you only the second .	3.6305555043807933
-- the younger ones out before the elder are married !	8.97288357608089
-- your younger sisters must be very young ?	5.802527467068764
yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	3.959169414816956
perhaps she is full young to be much in company .	10.28435331455783
but really , ma'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .	33060.33428194747
-- the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	74.20038246564717
and to be kept back on such a motive !	7.5167165503420215
-- i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind .	57.19433341544424
upon my word said her ladyship , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .	89.57015224114639
-- pray , what is your age ?	4.452816940224653
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling , your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .	69.05771618403458
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	1889.502380494132
you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , -- therefore you need not conceal your age .	95.43944254730003
i am not one and twenty .	2.916105514242932
when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	22.52846350576757
lady catherine , sir william , and mr. and mrs. collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her party .	17481.9292788263
their table was superlatively stupid .	1.685614401530898
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	17758.17861820585
a great deal more passed at the other table .	7.27077935317294
lady catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	84.5979195042645
mr. collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	1003.796448173083
sir william did not say much .	2.878025468417901
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	4.841394845494635
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs. collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	3442.717082893252
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	115.43077526497629
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr. collins's side , and as many bows on sir william's , they departed .	2756.7627115918453
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	179318.23794456417
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr. collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands .	1509.5541681903956
chapter vii.	1
sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	52054.85008012262
while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	454819193059.7638
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	6.775732261972627
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .	380105223.71605253
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	902309.1043480043
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	376.9277412482831
very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	2854750.4413578073
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	898.1188817310222
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	7155898.640791755
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	541454168.5882423
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	25789.998292108678
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses' reach .	242.54273539776344
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	577783.8119968179
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity .	1944251.1098974794
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	30.275140250792717
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	1559.0344993529463
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .	186951347120904.25
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	2048286.2779182172
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .	14.508543404374091
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr. collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	572646.1023097995
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding ,	3099.187792264969
i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility .	13.416887574742761
mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me .	13.643895817998636
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	1363.0134633003993
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	412.7233834500369
mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs. collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	126052.74630611189
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	5.88345678484295
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	205811.7525367858
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family .	172.63405134312686
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added ,	32.654742728643846
my eldest sister has been in town these three months .	10.782414301121596
have you never happened to see her there ?	5.254656582468114
she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .	1596928.826253142
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	16.354945970202998
chapter viii.	1
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings .	1478.3836341719361
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	41847715.637660965
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter .	63.547715822513496
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr. darcy they had only seen at church .	567.6412091413238
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room .	167.5325812359169
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	3906572.2363234945
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs. collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	3742.184871542689
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr. darcy .	25643713.061131023
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out ,	30925.76881735248
what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ?	5.150728695859945
what is it you are talking of ?	4.920301163161
what are you telling miss bennet ?	2.937050855461869
let me hear what it is .	3.8089302641341147
we are speaking of music , madam said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	74.94545370323046
of music !	1
then pray speak aloud .	1.4767831664375586
it is of all subjects my delight .	3.625396222423216
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	33.97383850564567
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	630.6719926345183
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient .	18.184841049846067
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	16.588217938423366
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	4.747584033950919
how does georgiana get on , darcy ?	3.8422518253425535
mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	8.237653034433231
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine ; and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal .	16118.163997715803
i assure you , madam he replied , that she does not need such advice .	15.37857428630825
she practises very constantly .	1.4634441244429397
so much the better .	1.4889221140597033
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	512.3331203817056
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	68.20993648432407
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs. collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in mrs. jenkinson's room .	3305446.2431495166
she would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house .	30.98479998146953
mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	28.67742433256283
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .	272.72086066122245
he drew a chair near her .	2.752396322482079
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	396916.03637763247
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said ,	423.0021996015124
you mean to frighten me , mr. darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	53.64712458403534
but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	20.70107446071595
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	54.252831362979805
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me .	5.302440638024139
i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied , because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own .	1360341.220990837
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say .	19789.73290599516
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .	13278.430632966425
indeed , mr. darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear .	1592022.2735812801
i am not afraid of you said he , smilingly .	6.656763330266556
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam .	24.06139865669931
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers .	10.500452806440604
you shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .	12.82371955060523
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	5640.567701861485
he danced only four dances !	2.047664676156584
i am sorry to pain you -- but so it was .	16.20213688907252
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	1868.2681187031653
mr. darcy , you cannot deny the fact .	5.803221213186064
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party .	78.54258011839505
true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	16.72919666573473
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ?	7.8900481248171594
my fingers wait your orders .	1.7253827300081694
perhaps said darcy , i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers .	423.12804505962947
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	7.756808973947631
said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam .	2.814029694747813
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?	1044.052021885272
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam , without applying to him .	12.439158558814505
it is because he will not give himself the trouble .	10.245688579767814
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy , of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .	240.52728715794103
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done .	106.15703083378358
my fingers said elizabeth , do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do .	105.02464188422698
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	30.358128266670835
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because i would not take the trouble of practising .	202.36486513812588
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution .	43.491215239457546
darcy smiled and said , you are perfectly right .	6.4171880186037455
you have employed your time much better .	3.499422659839691
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	34.97050918994535
we neither of us perform to strangers .	3.440517380855018
here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	70.12904056100167
elizabeth immediately began playing again .	1.9638176105235712
lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy ,	43.60309505096499
miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .	154.0548831078694
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne's .	42.955568596489734
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn .	24.181991202876134
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation .	37956219.51987973
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	38.52708481165361
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	3789.0847122231366
chapter ix.	1
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	142584.19892442104
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .	3505808.7378064743
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	1226.1988388074776
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	184.9628714770987
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed ,	58912.67750346026
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !	10.425303404170387
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .	6692.574082196631
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london .	32.331684274916555
perfectly so -- i thank you .	2.636388595861239
she found that she was to receive no other answer -- and , after a short pause , added ,	137.70584033413772
i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ?	67.6927942143067
i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	534.9843544359692
he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .	97.10781744517126
if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	9610.359096616014
but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle .	13677.572614474506
i should not be surprised said darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	208.20006611797615
elizabeth made no answer .	1.909201351511437
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	2708.626549515934
he took the hint , and soon began with , this seems a very comfortable house .	41.24148950565335
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford .	118.35254138570062
i believe she did -- and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .	147.9912834071045
mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife .	8.178964462277744
yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	10148.045148237505
my friend has an excellent understanding -- though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	645.8478128412186
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her .	123.00037146308087
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends .	192.07233329938035
an easy distance do you call it ?	4.377804780169808
it is nearly fifty miles .	1.94406276997366
and what is fifty miles of good road ?	5.052451649307127
little more than half a day's journey .	3.3304572793803233
yes , i call it a very easy distance .	7.850783239586835
i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth .	61.37294174434169
i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family .	24.617849111418256
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .	8.562830959845378
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far .	32.176634639431036
as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered ,	3426.541470990927
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	57.16647796545878
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	24.26950161516051
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .	31.150011175649187
but that is not the case here .	3.8663109615727764
mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance .	25509.019079679238
mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	489.83557337515384
you cannot have been always at longbourn .	5.115487482751277
elizabeth looked surprised .	1.3316284085906989
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice ,	2243.5129306529184
are you pleased with kent ?	2.0232382028792237
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	7669.092332485154
the tête-à-tête surprised them .	1.497266593769772
mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	1418.781908711341
what can be the meaning of this !	3.1706393160207185
said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	6.2350810769804035
my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	329.80598989914824
but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	6231068.86907207
all field sports were over .	1.9046504616908788
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	5353344.488818992
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	193.4936247450609
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	4594987655.23748
but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	63.10911128607179
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	117672.0163900172
he seldom appeared really animated .	1.806545881861959
mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .	7.767467288359199
colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .	6680784.2639346095
-- she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .	196.96443987357762
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	48.49026888541691
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	862.8735447593727
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	481756497.5023236
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .	22.650574710432657
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	62224.252699427205
chapter x.	1
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .	36.35889720851046
-- she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	38482.78268907182
-- how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !	12.846795905283846
-- yet it did , and even a third .	8.271895287994978
it seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	58612.66668210613
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .	31984917411.007072
his words seemed to imply it .	2.312384016774638
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	5.208791877762192
she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .	193.21285687449588
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .	378.9198967997362
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .	460533.3467847386
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said ,	13.58678763388766
i did not know before that you ever walked this way .	12.901382613145506
i have been making the tour of the park he replied , as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .	1298.5879436115854
are you going much farther ?	1.8957167132738217
no , i should have turned in a moment .	7.0949599531233165
and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .	20.08547551114125
do you certainly leave kent on saturday ?	3.871589264245013
said she .	1
yes -- if darcy does not put it off again .	11.636994335399509
but i am at his disposal .	2.0599425459277394
he arranges the business just as he pleases .	4.0826130347617475
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	172.43806193071623
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy .	210.65648818888664
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam .	17.278798828621703
but so we all do .	2.091393196668736
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	502.70696713091735
i speak feelingly .	1.1197562001281314
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence .	16.783991919166173
in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .	57.27152576706308
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	15.847985994630065
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?	418.70850423582846
these are home questions -- and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .	69.53502987907748
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .	20.430290297699095
younger sons cannot marry where they like .	3.7474764853064895
unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do .	35.831526157505806
our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money .	1278.9425682770093
is this thought elizabeth , meant for me ?	5.086830093223792
and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , and pray , what is the usual price of an earl's younger son ?	2748.6364213867837
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds .	62.859427519688865
he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	10.966479591702948
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said ,	146.67242042544385
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	46.29435193016229
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	27.699080317045805
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .	2912.478592473377
no said colonel fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	33.84582673317501
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy .	10.61155776178125
are you , indeed ?	1.983886747907025
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	4.8888051322531085
does your charge give you much trouble ?	3.92260418063398
young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .	3267.7239177548454
as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	87808.25747533771
she directly replied ,	1.1890055420765793
you need not be frightened .	2.5705822493556654
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	148.44218496449284
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley .	80.27757294480504
i think i have heard you say that you know them .	17.542000050304033
i know them a little .	2.672744176039564
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man -- he is a great friend of darcy's .	41.63353502287374
oh !	1
yes said elizabeth drily -- mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .	222.38579668091003
care of him !	1.3564802880363844
-- yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	126.39208571786148
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .	216.59608076970497
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .	179.23879623610307
it was all conjecture .	1.4639982136800986
what is it you mean ?	2.8083090430683635
it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing .	6205.435859567799
you may depend upon my not mentioning it .	5.151984995323961
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .	25.374972411701293
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .	152974290.29532567
did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?	7.882534959467219
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady .	11.136004181350783
and what arts did he use to separate them ?	5.735218415113393
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling .	15.423575342138845
he only told me , what i have now told you .	12.7302539791117
elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	23.438749392097325
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	25.922526067847073
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she .	14.903096574537166
your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	4.182592822339251
why was he to be the judge ?	3.6656452138087574
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	5.35172363853344
i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	50107.56961350033
but she continued , recollecting herself , as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	197.024046349359
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case .	17.564902074087975
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam , but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly .	67.15455319850608
this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	65569.86591146006
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	551.2929353494306
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	102.7421372310308
there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .	70.60140307327974
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	6030.217604667926
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	9733.323856989251
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	4258.59224358839
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .	15311.024343402049
to jane herself she exclaimed , there could be no possibility of objection .	15.882114212111997
all loveliness and goodness as she is !	3.8310147819864366
her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	11.328853194078562
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	5199.518850181846
when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .	24676537526.228783
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	680892.2194134991
mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	162357.61582778662
chapter xi.	1
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .	31684.001236373777
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	64.26974198181004
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	431122.4403111905
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	163.72971865316586
mr. darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	138.8006463521061
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	2404813.408055383
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	655645.0091092504
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	518152.5479368034
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .	1465.1201254279254
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	648.1880546789089
she answered him with cold civility .	3.7290190135654306
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	43.58808118494278
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	6.128636000138978
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began ,	82.98028206222972
in vain have i struggled .	2.020442550872939
it will not do .	1.8371319157602641
my feelings will not be repressed .	2.1978697707139823
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you .	16.698375684592015
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	2.2554161359986127
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	4.0037908714937025
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	213.329576652275
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	1632.9236299843344
his sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	149893.7820934588
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	4715706.412641882
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	70.7071156156623
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	25775.57367765307
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	68.80766278268321
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	16.309760758397363
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said ,	194.05024044190986
in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	2664.7615485945257
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .	155.17238386197974
but i cannot -- i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	115.11606081189463
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	9.841646784371287
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .	33.59129905339713
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .	1050.5643646514427
mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	777.7324492607229
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	48.98491763482856
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	325.848346347039
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	3.805871006514795
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said ,	14.874338494478542
and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !	22.260681654412735
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .	138.8580398228133
but it is of small importance .	2.9214788160392864
i might as well enquire replied she , why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	57681.30165874171
was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?	12.235048934089683
but i have other provocations .	1.7320246673546549
you know i have .	2.034954072136225
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?	2052623.5752709615
as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	547.96841897694
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	13.131433607934035
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .	8.576889055278976
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind .	2442388.9455596823
she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	291.7164492362682
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	12.272652932072846
can you deny that you have done it ?	4.525535797547124
she repeated .	1
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .	7700.701482055277
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself .	4.434652211008639
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	175.22975055903092
but it is not merely this affair she continued , on which my dislike is founded .	26.389244668347015
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	18.954323045673764
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .	55.729944828963895
on this subject , what can you have to say ?	14.278208138389434
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	9.497916324061881
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?	9.662698407646884
you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	203.75997714256857
who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?	48.40304813091088
his misfortunes !	1
repeated darcy contemptuously ; yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed .	10.204891281464489
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy .	4.869762773182211
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	13.34031243135502
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	48.900371025930845
you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .	256.44795618562387
you have done all this !	2.262673505030711
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule .	17.222660468493597
and this cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , is your opinion of me !	148.17318622675757
this is the estimation in which you hold me !	5.839559667477685
i thank you for explaining it so fully .	5.523368214452356
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	6.442666448245991
but perhaps added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	24343.971661027128
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	12461.262164782695
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	4.364045441666327
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .	7.21770835296228
they were natural and just .	2.2011714552641592
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	12.813767368075762
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?	78.40318253334604
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said ,	244.09455019768228
you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	274101.7595922528
she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued ,	40.52242272562011
you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .	574.2877327071557
again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	38.360526360640016
she went on .	1.4342650569418804
from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry .	20858469484.490475
you have said quite enough , madam .	4.450700564656587
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	128.05829926237215
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .	297.89734301676975
and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	413.77148382721083
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	8.27725906865975
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	57.669255914523625
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	62.031576854475084
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !	12.17912118443899
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	28.586148446083094
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	130687.43947477528
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	7.684852645634833
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	26416300.918890797
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	1931.1777470694424
chapter xii.	1
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	76.49293628777384
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	37696.35263953711
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	17395.588261859604
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	88.83998957974663
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	1988.682877053293
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	4174.571556040076
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .	46634.35106817689
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	172.83739631986646
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	1501.442727981008
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	41785.63440528152
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	6.792968501253575
-- and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	128.0336950516318
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .	22194.14482498612
-- the envelope itself was likewise full .	3.0149713208206133
-- pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	17.822558431011213
it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows --	59.126498146285606
be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	7745.564621441921
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	6776985.757698363
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .	2108.783693803376
two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	180.40285722921757
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr. bingley from your sister , -- and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham .	1279042.944529531
-- wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .	451905391.9836353
-- but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .	17750.5666284721
-- if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , i can only say that i am sorry .	7799.433005009711
-- the necessity must be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd .	14.064064691956126
-- i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .	7330.390587815942
-- but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .	668.2742922872432
-- i had often seen him in love before .	10.45733792818489
-- at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas's accidental information , that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	93872.08995193042
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	82.70950490903236
from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .	1401.5688319683547
your sister i also watched .	2.1572646760475553
-- her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	253974.9237018588
-- if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error .	69.19675533125857
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .	13.567355185006571
-- if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	866.6738473618713
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .	239147.65824013532
-- that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , -- but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .	2115.0396118293415
-- i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; -- i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .	1232.2626970736642
-- my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .	344701.63402808027
-- but there were other causes of repugnance ; -- causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .	17105.520960413018
-- these causes must be stated , though briefly .	4.836559755986466
-- the situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .	62151.345530540246
-- pardon me .	1.3448499700121261
-- it pains me to offend you .	3.2898331332469386
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	33441006.220998324
-- i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .	232089.36949179237
-- he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .	835.4772873527611
-- the part which i acted , is now to be explained .	15.72619376092974
-- his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london .	36469.992840466155
-- we accordingly went -- and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .	826.6350781136287
-- i described , and enforced them earnestly .	3.506392719071308
-- but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	97225.56402036935
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .	83.2160559579589
-- but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .	78.99189491201557
-- to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	60.632382293372586
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .	248.2923161118582
-- i cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	8.491338675720332
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	84130.10464886516
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .	309.2651505455407
-- that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; -- but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .	4232.276336018718
-- perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .	8.489980329797534
-- it is done , however , and it was done for the best .	21.582959686560372
-- on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	60.81815835219256
if i have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .	3367.8128472241133
-- with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	3302.225167594181
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	1869.6591931909925
mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	6107900.021567006
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; -- most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .	25587.194916006778
my father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	62084.701254695836
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .	301.3300991874441
the vicious propensities -- the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .	799206.4960341491
here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell .	37.87201708807776
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	548.539808961366
it adds even another motive .	2.0271244273112177
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	40087167.618450396
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	5.1428293073329625
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	15974871.575722858
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	1933.8553556962252
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	239.76541481606864
i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	8.952082630320167
the business was therefore soon settled .	3.0503327804929024
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	3120.7424191345767
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .	3.1171575319539393
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .	69.88009313023083
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .	5620.384315334286
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	16190.092357441725
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	104.97484068643737
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	17008165.816444907
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	72.41035055128961
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	3124.9865327979196
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	7.936155616769585
how he lived i know not .	2.6377747326999423
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	11.159447452278929
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	2883.7100478233883
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .	16.74925636374928
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .	833.6659897064894
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	11456911898273.623
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .	2649.598295374414
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	27860.610752162822
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .	13.745885597890306
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .	6733.157596883552
mr. wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	2434.1542989604313
his revenge would have been complete indeed .	2.6263389790534095
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .	42238.248597746
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	1388.8353700437601
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	514.9257652877461
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	15.038068893595156
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	73.70911673287463
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	311159.8204101381
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	468382.2096970654
i will only add , god bless you .	3.860889480537269
fitzwilliam darcy.	1
chapter xiii.	1
if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	6868.741912427878
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	329.10813558418425
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .	8.370749861079377
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	37349.892781241615
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .	225.32474191110876
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	20793.0403739368
his belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	40559.43874063689
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .	116.20184894709459
it was all pride and insolence .	2.3487434018144855
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	13545506.199642349
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	6.197772837622616
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , this must be false !	26.197893333450327
this cannot be !	1.4082163931880354
this must be the grossest falsehood !	2.6115926432567558
-- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	85135.07036037945
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	46000960.42017715
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	26890.929267215277
so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	118.3952403375248
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	1019726.1613248212
but when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	79639.0362931351
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success .	575.0379142552868
on both sides it was only assertion .	3.8681363849165957
again she read on .	1.780060628394582
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	261530.61891008576
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	2345.94957505041
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ---- shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .	83520.91340783151
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .	113.44598016577488
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	233.6120170058596
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	111.11904081003354
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	4546856.669162508
but no such recollection befriended her .	2.4220962143197697
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	75386.59984351949
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	39.54986169561229
but , alas !	1.0368959072618449
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	234429252.9904121
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	1131211.0788599134
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr. philips's .	475.2892751215224
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	8.509647025395806
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	139.03855713552431
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	117.43042169379213
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy -- that mr. darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .	46650.512373477555
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	113284219.6533351
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	11.690693644064472
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	9185.744599021571
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	26523.6286847451
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow that mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	208583357596.46252
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .	72931.31376315832
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible .	144297.05408001225
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .	2.5474881182127906
-- of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	126.33560592388947
how despicably have i acted !	2.3213820428443155
she cried .	1
-- i , who have prided myself on my discernment !	6.8412960868297406
-- i , who have valued myself on my abilities !	7.657142704911713
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .	94.26744305087088
-- how humiliating is this discovery !	2.7714094286642883
-- yet , how just a humiliation !	3.8371998525701425
-- had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind .	32.44583128365254
but vanity , not love , has been my folly .	9.854057937896965
-- pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	26206.52681502541
till this moment , i never knew myself .	4.3298682667932065
from herself to jane -- from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again .	25924.136071029683
widely different was the effect of a second perusal .	6.459390049426784
-- how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?	852.9524806970836
-- he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment ; -- and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been .	514.2731385032223
-- neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .	16.843673123209804
-- she felt that jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	4508.126544877361
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	1867.241649013706
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	256321.3075638813
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	12.21647173382404
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family ; -- and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	16812290.388029736
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	984339145.8061806
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr. darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .	8078148.807908477
-- elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .	41.59618590266132
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	4.397075429623263
she could think only of her letter .	4.100470135163403
chapter xiv.	1
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr. collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings .	5975265.943238125
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	1256018.2258693404
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	170710.9483088776
what would she have said ?	2.3250914686734894
-- how would she have behaved ?	2.7532674549144383
were questions with which she amused herself .	3.558392761024734
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party .	6.385001416857486
-- i assure you , i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine ; i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do .	490.1339413886237
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me !	69.93240208775747
-- they were excessively sorry to go !	4.055752444218424
but so they always are .	2.114836125170533
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year .	948.741584991652
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases .	3.7462849279236856
mr. collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	553.241668726885
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added ,	22062.598192767204
but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	462.0075572627648
mrs. collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure .	32.232755677484214
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth , but it is not in my power to accept it .	321.5777718972018
-- i must be in town next saturday .	5.152880109809295
why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	31.258734925103074
i expected you to stay two months .	3.539809673939361
i told mrs. collins so before you came .	6.1455145340721735
there can be no occasion for your going so soon .	9.84460082451389
mrs. bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight .	6.3279125404219805
but my father cannot .	1.9026629082783348
-- he wrote last week to hurry my return .	5.40771777945466
oh !	1
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .	16.894576265003217
-- daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	14.172556553140279
and if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large .	3714168762.6166825
you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan .	48.53529055650999
lady catherine seemed resigned .	1.629355422714913
mrs. collins , you must send a servant with them .	8.144686210461229
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	271.10608858345466
it is highly improper .	1.3842289104620145
you must contrive to send somebody .	2.5805785293599457
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .	18.56429870340476
-- young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .	31.802006623931096
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	349.0341666417365
-- miss darcy , the daughter of mr. darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .	881.1741485572225
-- i am excessively attentive to all those things .	5.376415080662364
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs. collins .	15.186212371520412
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone .	456.862510781907
my uncle is to send a servant for us .	9.207037839652266
oh !	1
-- your uncle !	1.4005916789811435
-- he keeps a man-servant , does he ?	3.8802345971407215
-- i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	19.24305277062619
where shall you change horses ?	1.8413456391374878
-- oh !	1
bromley , of course .	2.027442488257363
-- if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to .	30.99468886981358
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	323122.21081377304
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	162208.36072367162
mr. darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	24.910957007329053
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	31.646005102167717
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	36251.596669615305
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	7368.145274754389
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	925.9823128769348
they were hopeless of remedy .	1.9044765195652111
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	20336.900242523083
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	4052.3995475751194
catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	1461.6212801972154
they were ignorant , idle , and vain .	3.633718236281995
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	3656.023851757789
anxiety on jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr. darcy's explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost .	4648.102866461282
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	792.2846841323443
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	47362.63629123869
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	95233.70230059022
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	266.6483530425699
the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	31144155.730444413
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	68727.85794981034
chapter xv.	1
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	1191.8505130320839
i know not , miss elizabeth said he , whether mrs. collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	59136.53021037257
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .	22.499309639237502
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .	35.22702269625886
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .	5480808.841692161
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	8.594802055731884
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .	2769.1254440963326
mr. collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied ,	9.559862359603738
it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	62.61815567093822
we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	1368709.157092347
our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	64.65726330155853
you see on what a footing we are .	4.9270588270951095
you see how continually we are engaged there .	4.843622563480977
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings .	34650.66889128685
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	1531.07894056251
you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	91.85209701194859
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	20.402300971632155
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs. collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	71937.96558848092
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	307.48220276910513
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .	27.307705563330657
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	36.4910081112765
we seem to have been designed for each other .	6.017658219539119
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	1345.3523383524548
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	255.22137591806464
poor charlotte !	1
-- it was melancholy to leave her to such society !	9.390192814684637
-- but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	2215.3829328122238
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	291.1385595500272
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	230.5432616771448
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr. collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner , though unknown .	32699417.18190665
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings .	49064.84871664032
but he added , you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here .	2650.150134896459
elizabeth made no objection ; -- the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	154.67042077985212
good gracious !	1
cried maria , after a few minutes silence , it seems but a day or two since we first came !	128.1563769418984
-- and yet how many things have happened !	5.631714025869018
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh .	9.098698823968492
we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !	9.719153389799475
-- how much i shall have to tell !	7.886607250552078
elizabeth privately added , and how much i shall have to conceal .	23.85512652899868
their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr. gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	10861.011396602958
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	811.0619236437302
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	111.36267448570248
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr. darcy's proposals .	223.21605372765805
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	76336459781.81804
chapter xvi.	1
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch-street , for the town of ---- in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	28681557.142009523
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	839.5349983747177
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , is not this nice ?	761.7881461827886
is not this an agreeable surprise ?	3.262881893624905
and we mean to treat you all added lydia ; but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there .	945.3808310923271
then shewing her purchases look here , i have bought this bonnet .	9.87818865746795
i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not .	119.72110092270682
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better .	206.38578586209465
and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , oh !	35.068307634295195
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable .	1362.632047690208
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ---- shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	1074.9989220923728
are they indeed ?	1.2365045322247201
cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	4.313860665599153
they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	268.5148792646902
it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	31.069567939536174
mamma would like to go too of all things !	8.058065592726997
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !	8.718494316353539
yes thought elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	155.98903460510365
good heaven !	1
brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton .	548.8788076848197
now i have got some news for you said lydia , as they sat down to table .	58.48701236303734
what do you think ?	1.7347291447189719
it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like .	46.74318978470486
jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	38.55467659135697
lydia laughed , and said ,	2.4482152433189617
aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	8.12501734655002
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	18.95872526470273
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say .	30.76854820040678
but he is an ugly fellow !	2.797119930461739
i am glad he is gone .	3.810428029445153
i never saw such a long chin in my life .	11.06671671852453
well , but now for my news it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?	352.664356396208
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king .	5.314009347171433
there's for you !	1.4038462111897145
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool ; gone to stay .	19.84327282310105
wickham is safe .	1.3263860276457986
and mary king is safe !	2.33930582558514
added elizabeth ; safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune .	14.32121879299492
she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .	18.523841316190108
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane .	15.22387147811379
i am sure there is not on his .	5.4057070001793655
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	12.622543010978953
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ?	4.001607290621473
elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	3555.741286246497
as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	123621.23731641097
how nicely we are crammed in !	2.3958583507414666
cried lydia .	1
i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	66.77800004116747
well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	101.48265486014404
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	199.9385357771548
have you seen any pleasant men ?	2.558659351401005
have you had any flirting ?	2.3340960440919942
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	119.4821525580008
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare .	13.098560659019887
she is almost three and twenty !	2.6313699744623102
lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty !	30.42301935155609
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	18.97227691940478
she says lizzy had better have taken mr. collins ; but i do not think there would have been any fun in it .	199.2021875030726
lord !	1
how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls .	307.7712559672707
dear me !	1
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster's .	21.88480562737128
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , mrs. forster and me are such friends !	8311.606018431414
) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?	4872.914649165866
we dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , -- only think what fun !	121.80165397683429
not a soul knew of it , but col .	4.827361381477659
and mrs. forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	5198.985729332124
when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	792.6848589020024
lord !	1
how i laughed !	1.2245642659632523
and so did mrs. forster .	2.315395998965966
i thought i should have died .	2.5478280384619927
and that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter .	92.66333364587388
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn .	1480.1948534957155
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name .	98.4361546300293
their reception at home was most kind .	4.677806289341148
mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth ,	287.1892241510488
i am glad you are come back , lizzy .	7.819334726537211
their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs. bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	10241930077374.268
oh !	1
mary said she , i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	83.46520245837907
as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	1591423248.6501036
and then when we came away it was such fun !	10.119424702062227
i thought we never should have got into the coach .	8.358306920669918
i was ready to die of laughter .	2.9128131963910397
and then we were so merry all the way home !	11.31759171285563
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !	52.87398806409661
to this , mary very gravely replied , far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	110.42063594436303
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	6.21508271939876
but i confess they would have no charms for me .	8.59259714531458
i should infinitely prefer a book .	2.6111137003524325
but of this answer lydia heard not a word .	6.1107872646657935
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all .	133.2414444671254
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	1614.6285328506813
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	856.7905467997225
there was another reason too for her opposition .	4.840593914977655
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	32.437565729196415
the comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	29.54110240775419
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	850.9140229502392
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	9627.19123392072
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	25693.70987068314
chapter xvii.	1
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .	1062848.6694060687
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	1165.0110600810658
she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	15738.480193563886
his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong said she ; and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment .	1595.8016847914234
indeed replied elizabeth , i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	459.95955438177066
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?	8.740269957341072
blame you !	1
oh , no .	1.4265211649623222
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham .	11.42469423658009
no -- i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did .	32.62541502145842
but you will know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day .	88.08901068295394
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .	105.21726831598093
what a stroke was this for poor jane !	3.8706276228687115
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	881.9610160287926
nor was darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	53.161493529652205
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	103.68276607287964
this will not do said elizabeth .	3.430854013273895
you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	20.126204657300647
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	18.690791261482786
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	1082.6916181551248
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr. darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse .	191.17612267706232
it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane .	25.22191242811432
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she .	14.558988273327492
wickham so very bad !	1.8766765903662301
it is almost past belief .	1.9863568840377697
and poor mr. darcy !	1.652980511482166
dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	7.912845564329603
such a disappointment !	1.2316392285900255
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	5.321302172802896
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	9.537355553258495
it is really too distressing .	2.157430152394237
i am sure you must feel it so .	6.4937931353090965
oh !	1
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	70.92131320863375
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	99.3817755843302
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather .	268.174637886701
poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	24.084830954887323
such an openness and gentleness in his manner .	4.421899576762106
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	25.670723808346597
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it .	25.034899274689394
i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do .	52.39953475582836
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	90.48106410337967
it is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	107.00228211283687
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty .	589.5751262729851
lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	217.91002079203602
indeed i could not .	1.6076538472694837
i was uncomfortable enough .	1.3787273880449684
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy .	6.487285721243584
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !	38825.30014329323
oh !	1
how i wanted you !	1.5291544833509687
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved .	487.4032819030556
certainly .	1
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .	88.90508241166174
there is one point , on which i want your advice .	13.532190140787
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character .	220.34772082099622
miss bennet paused a little and then replied , surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	87.57183876092095
what is your own opinion ?	2.5090878717780773
that it ought not to be attempted .	2.7761363636376593
mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	12.156790505459687
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	28888.171712930663
the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	4139.373159667767
i am not equal to it .	2.48811374682426
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	106.97712223851313
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .	204.4075204277053
at present i will say nothing about it .	5.872724054228578
you are quite right .	1.601297097355814
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	9.166042012503194
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	50.494958698647245
we must not make him desperate .	2.9988988455089203
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	9.579617314919359
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	8886.154011378485
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	13.925342271730395
she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	558.840949006046
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	3929.295017848394
and then said she , if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	2160.489605227103
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !	25.212243375938648
she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	204.03950082414542
jane was not happy .	1.729875224651174
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .	5.939852991969555
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	12384159928.8992
well , lizzy said mrs. bennet one day , what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane's ?	186.380488236486
for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	37.09525953348118
i told my sister philips so the other day .	7.644643507974403
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .	24.69245238969559
well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	1849.287687205803
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know .	1027.226564392262
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more .	19.026200053832653
oh , well !	1.390780640734402
it is just as he chooses .	2.858909187812703
nobody wants him to come .	2.327991473538881
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .	692.972860914108
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	1084.0766210485936
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	36.08324568775796
well , lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards , and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	121.97016325754417
well , well , i only hope it will last .	9.83464056029903
and what sort of table do they keep ?	3.232880688657618
charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .	4.611095821467588
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	24.66644399694441
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say .	6.378651034613892
no , nothing at all .	2.10729371716278
a great deal of good management , depend upon it .	7.735720313872126
yes , yes .	1.4434076655982986
they will take care not to outrun their income .	5.38628672237688
they will never be distressed for money .	3.7300358181346533
well , much good may it do them !	4.75314820118043
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .	34.669677891329
they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens .	42.85540925395711
it was a subject which they could not mention before me .	11.259044856628076
no .	1
it would have been strange if they had .	4.277172183286214
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	17.392574701973796
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	218.28556311161245
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me .	19.473968969765995
chapter xviii.	1
the first week of their return was soon gone .	7.198187774376923
the second began .	1.2295615791372145
it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	206.38616290590028
the dejection was almost universal .	2.0596004945743434
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	116.65666913204628
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	1664.8375715046268
good heaven !	1
what is to become of us !	2.627813574017805
what are we to do !	2.1577330026650254
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	4.454179841650406
how can you be smiling so , lizzy ?	5.992528800452023
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	391.43130889990215
i am sure said she , i cried for two days together when colonel millar's regiment went away .	43.47918200008959
i thought i should have broke my heart .	4.377851677651579
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia .	6.482695489190533
if one could but go to brighton !	3.0769152671374744
observed mrs. bennet .	1.403289943244262
oh , yes !	1.3053693132800441
-- if one could but go to brighton !	3.5725201643944686
but papa is so disagreeable .	2.2760915772471177
a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever .	4.078956557643523
and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty .	47.516445505385796
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn-house .	4.776821439191232
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	52.94769413700355
she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	920.9247060493713
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .	8859.094500271183
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	19.305712667347912
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two .	1305.9056522173512
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .	2968.41034761978
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	338535.6759092318
i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she , though i am not her particular friend .	242.0375972595453
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older .	398.6832496137032
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .	38.22326712408411
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	77868956.27448018
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	944653.6192122316
he heard her attentively , and then said ,	4.096147855654214
lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .	35514.16699298544
if you were aware said elizabeth , of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair .	401553.8780419625
already arisen !	1
repeated mr. bennet .	1.406642113489413
what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	8.552380303832058
poor little lizzy !	1.3350597895394978
but do not be cast down .	2.80306149684547
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	64.67522250424615
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly .	54.89043706968107
indeed you are mistaken .	2.028523825825794
i have no such injuries to resent .	3.030156874085115
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining .	46.36285638668189
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character .	890.3277045780642
excuse me -- for i must speak plainly .	6.358362514168384
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .	52438.42313324383
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	644.3319228510977
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	130446.1222764881
in this danger kitty is also comprehended .	3.404076782100622
she will follow wherever lydia leads .	2.220001122088354
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	3.866285351236665
oh !	1
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?	3474.5854931999224
mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply ,	125.05342129993073
do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	5.302990628687937
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or i may say , three very silly sisters .	10935.35773425902
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .	26.149556986444566
let her go then .	1.748154852395055
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	1636.5838418596147
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	71.67313610448146
the officers will find women better worth their notice .	5.612432242566113
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	36.90569273435816
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life .	209.96753555257894
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	390.044010509748
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	52.34970583101902
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	546.5571310585757
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	448.254131692187
in lydia's imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	16.4337432562316
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	50.20466592584107
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	62.761143989510465
she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	189652.02498831225
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	425.8989693869773
they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	56.67786112464878
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	240.40745044419185
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home .	381.94955089617935
elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time .	17.13002068464088
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	181.86936247716386
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	310.5466490952094
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	267968.33145335515
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	33244619.575899206
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr. darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	1116730348.5880177
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	129164.44908125047
her answer was warmly in his favour .	3.5663158334369833
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , how long did you say that he was at rosings ?	187.75616849504846
nearly three weeks .	1.3204817571418859
and you saw him frequently ?	2.5040199203851214
yes , almost every day .	2.13240216852668
his manners are very different from his cousin's .	8.047607411973019
yes , very different .	1.9091246326819242
but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance .	4.514080794319414
indeed !	1
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her .	8.807435170346285
and pray may i ask ?	2.255461223046195
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , is it in address that he improves ?	85.62835410151804
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	12.273491481885298
for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone , that he is improved in essentials .	164.86862230170337
oh , no !	1.419999394339874
said elizabeth .	1
in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was .	34.27842203895765
while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	174.23204075749786
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added ,	152.05627793357874
when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .	15770.17431951549
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents ,	27940.434248508573
you , who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .	4763.813920449669
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .	11162.829030025925
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	20205.1934102161
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart .	169790.02320017864
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	103.26131809462595
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	709.3941697095529
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	65375.17888251224
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	594.0838405585089
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	13.162781273799453
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .	43.073700078344395
mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	113909003.42470896
chapter xix.	1
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	514.9846207634683
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	142622.25223580512
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	178.70063945634317
but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	17362.841276648818
he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	61.09505403817161
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	115.05897839952684
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	10091.772392228671
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	76.3895527573036
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	8077747.348145947
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	13318476.434744406
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	155.89481117752416
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	35775912547.37408
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	62035.531176872704
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	285426.3466676347
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	865881.5165013352
but it is fortunate thought she , that i have something to wish for .	22.23251746479784
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	11.044050987582903
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	1008.6156617773735
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	1278.695555639804
when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	6036.299839251052
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; -- and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	175494527775359.5
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn .	281.681843351212
everything wore a happier aspect .	2.1142193791315176
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	128.09855405517555
mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton .	610611586.2142413
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	19975.243851544292
mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire .	87983365530.9726
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	1110.4875866724394
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak .	221768.76083671526
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough .	348.8692087514886
but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .	392.1868382743787
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	9.340077540082314
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .	53.938899298326334
but surely said she , i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .	162.5451995208874
the period of expectation was now doubled .	3.3183370843240323
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	13.168238342534854
but they did pass away , and mr. and mrs. gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn .	296.4968845740037
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	12252428.25980365
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	413.42338387910934
one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	26729.55416371588
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c .	4361.9107441886135
are sufficiently known .	1.235312153744333
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern .	9.316396242562346
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs. gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated .	7266669.800131107
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	88.43899564403203
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	165.40627066528202
mr. gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	20.770551391167924
my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?	162.92988567209306
said her aunt .	1.4113994465068787
a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	27.038545510883413
wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	7.255526177981187
elizabeth was distressed .	1.1378939527401744
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	57.92202449877535
she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	494.7138119230863
mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity .	1.7727176165979668
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she , i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .	388.395659552026
they have some of the finest woods in the country .	7.492538138810396
elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce .	9.377364397755509
the possibility of meeting mr. darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	16.279196490442235
it would be dreadful !	1.4449266461551362
she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	770.0096768812073
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	3429.3052584016696
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	80429.59896526241
a most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	91924277.01728436
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	5.214056835728716

chapter i.	1
elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	9434.117226266051
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	13.71784034191816
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	253.5271243882404
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	102.1580892914486
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	167131.34167280456
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; -- and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	55786.57013506586
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .	4.705672747983454
elizabeth was delighted .	1.269893304641493
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	685.4299421292448
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !	548.0894025759243
they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	2602.2896596424553
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	4.693706079961485
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	7959.359719869862
the housekeeper came ; a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	710.0953539376873
they followed her into the dining-parlour .	2.7735540138893424
it was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	8.561193404298896
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	33.71600486454242
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	280.51145267067466
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	31189.45228821035
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	237.33785652712035
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .	340257.6463822266
and of this place thought she , i might have been mistress !	12.319511770593781
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted !	7.638677219920637
instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .	1150.7281688676999
-- but no -- recollecting herself , -- that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them .	2104.839504745318
this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret .	20.244035550119083
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	215.4563486296654
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs. reynolds replied , that he was , adding , but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends .	45316.170843581735
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	57.441867992773474
her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	10.438845065290971
she approached , and saw the likeness of mr. wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	78.63704321691777
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	12.583451078364323
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .	19307.245046880125
-- he is now gone into the army she added , but i am afraid he has turned out very wild .	98.02124897115493
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it .	34.9513481154567
and that said mrs. reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master -- and very like him .	186.83185094115208
it was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago .	23.319025551911285
i have heard much of your master's fine person said mrs. gardiner , looking at the picture ; it is a handsome face .	245.83806947904148
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	28.26058131495703
mrs. reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	36.721164471933356
does that young lady know mr. darcy ?	3.7655125081628977
elizabeth coloured , and said -- a little .	5.3195300412396875
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ?	21.21649850345882
yes , very handsome .	1.8609434679637658
i am sure i know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	1178.1897362530724
this room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	90.8599513368341
he was very fond of them .	2.4230143143641745
this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham's being among them .	9.202145477930168
mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	96.32663250476152
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ?	7.27864042114348
said mr. gardiner .	1.3995417435069324
oh !	1
yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished !	22.872156210966182
-- she plays and sings all day long .	3.171043821592265
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master ; she comes here to-morrow with him .	765.4559585615374
mr. gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs. reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	22680.22556551468
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ?	14.740013666192183
not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months .	4657.750239063775
except thought elizabeth , when she goes to ramsgate .	5.261316004046314
if your master would marry , you might see more of him .	17.20021350991654
yes , sir ; but i do not know when that will be .	22.134011928679705
i do not know who is good enough for him .	7.282180818003902
mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled .	1.9811650047156666
elizabeth could not help saying , it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so .	582.2934008353884
i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him replied the other .	121.08451224458348
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old .	49313.78461097789
this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	34.4196073785887
that he was not a good-tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	11.405029274583805
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying ,	75.21207120084307
there are very few people of whom so much can be said .	19.29006808528935
you are lucky in having such a master .	4.540257619667108
yes , sir , i know i am .	6.962964150492908
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better .	49.05116814285506
but i have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world .	3370.381882957262
elizabeth almost stared at her .	2.18861030110131
-- can this be mr. darcy !	2.4477898586519156
thought she .	1
his father was an excellent man said mrs. gardiner .	7.8978906325564395
yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor .	283.3213456216009
elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	7.7539506651730825
mrs. reynolds could interest her on no other point .	6.536425194493244
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	222.4009771353655
mr. gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	75282.1982769414
he is the best landlord , and the best master said she , that ever lived .	29.131469170551956
not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	22.126734736956806
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	57.70058637963483
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it .	72.48147778942833
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .	35.92503185692101
in what an amiable light does this place him !	7.422224963432083
thought elizabeth .	1
this fine account of him whispered her aunt , as they walked , is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend .	287.6843420022427
perhaps we might be deceived .	2.525000607346937
that is not very likely ; our authority was too good .	11.041841347814021
on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley .	3114488.2707549534
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	51.31806763128002
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	15.335175438484217
and this is always the way with him she added .	11.479519950781658
-- whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	86.86493426304033
there is nothing he would not do for her .	8.72085895428901
the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	81.90438811441672
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	487656.2073435093
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	221.07890760490193
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	42.518573311480594
at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	9160.541837392673
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	193.5030194878147
mrs. reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	21.02946056188644
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	2631.348108968982
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature .	21.58482123396954
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	15.455231138396169
as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship !	174.3471553063839
-- how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !	34.22289158697113
-- how much of good or evil must be done by him !	20.050663941436664
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	36245968.150707826
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	40977.21895169191
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	1500614.9349829003
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	274.49467132532425
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .	25.76157147707312
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	35837.01028653448
she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	240.58936691479337
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	158324.20751400758
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	41893.35140697025
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	2510817.4458548673
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	8827496.244654533
at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	1874.0084761682126
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	3393.968766865374
she was overpowered by shame and vexation .	2.680450008603784
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	32.06839943836344
how strange must it appear to him !	3.884509928427135
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	13.990909546776122
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	26.816351864341495
oh !	1
why did she come ?	1.7360134939732041
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	29.65093994185582
had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	17866.82819593161
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	8.592557662578175
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , -- what could it mean ?	20.895921169609288
that he should even speak to her was amazing !	5.429962583514389
-- but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	27.929963929797978
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	597.6865070820967
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park , when he put his letter into her hand !	165.24933264966603
she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	30.591024159366423
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	14688132233.612684
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .	361.3023668637381
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	21280.70964651278
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .	1704.4061117273814
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	2209.463793108605
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	583.2157171297845
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	7967475.301205219
mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	118.21986555831286
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	27.016090620842064
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	17718.598420818187
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	366414.0540413537
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	119184.7925986509
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	1456826446.2730713
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	21169.41624479182
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	158.58753026262013
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	3957.56007424462
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	80.95779072298868
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .	238.17814390463823
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	19373057.622652397
her colour changed , and she said no more .	5.0303553384560775
mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	1892.8160527834748
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	195956.02286168025
what will be his surprise thought she , when he knows who they are !	28.086376716567717
he takes them now for people of fashion .	4.826188982363305
the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	251040.5762110794
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .	7185.439149211565
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	12.804351645270948
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	73.5839238736907
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	7657.557836462076
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	4693498.302678548
mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	108.3781599580372
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .	67.8633016837779
her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , why is he so altered ?	65.0592792029288
from what can it proceed ?	2.333720339769658
it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .	78.84372245507626
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .	15.504290307530702
it is impossible that he should still love me .	6.195770328270064
after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	253879.00960569756
it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	1487.5861309197048
mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	35.29878810823624
after a short silence , the lady first spoke .	8.752005618957275
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected -- for your housekeeper she added , informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .	122995724.91112846
he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	7531.897881790201
they will join me early to-morrow he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , -- mr. bingley and his sisters .	998.369394463936
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	3.8428765444102955
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .	23677.61569164689
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , -- will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ?	920504.2943408125
the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	446.0119541226519
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	209198.12677387532
they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .	17.147565719761598
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .	34.83157973720455
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	55.738881173972025
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	716.5095798027214
he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	303.06568604978236
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	49.40735740262115
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	21.821079355519366
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .	90.93901514375887
yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over .	219.5660275261464
on mr. and mrs. gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	9454.910922869507
mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	306.2529321918002
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	269.79453239836477
he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming said her uncle .	18.920288372170916
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt , but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	601.6194380897854
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it .	296.53761456312554
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	13.056182636300711
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .	80.31000097940822
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling .	4.766556257578917
to be sure , lizzy said her aunt , he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	4817.316210365069
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?	16.354855757094647
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	7315.416740776719
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle .	31.503355448294325
your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds .	3144.6294558431077
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	20.938147885299912
from what we have seen of him continued mrs. gardiner , i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .	28124.851898473487
he has not an ill-natured look .	3.10353078075939
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	15.773616539594222
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	289.9724018807255
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	169.2743322769157
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	4.1585934835882234
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue .	156.9021120261519
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire .	1505108331.7704139
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	10680.682165146616
mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	2070471.3695887236
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	35691.60402036195
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	1339670.7427918483
chapter ii.	1
elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	52419.41430942931
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came .	171.99763887616422
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	3304489.6928588264
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	1311.912561422081
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	56052.05806014468
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	10198.119995115965
while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	58.6804447614803
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	328885.17103476636
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	30369.632063435103
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	22.572611965485265
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	91.43120245294396
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	3560.734197901377
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	20.664029690091446
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	1616.9501389106317
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	763.1576793533376
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	1620.9884752234805
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	1635136.239361156
all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	43390.12407583572
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	1162.3712517337972
to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	23.047501525389638
they had long wished to see him .	4.396193767296151
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	10.811768128699999
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr. darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	291547.56105978554
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	127.93859883569185
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	12.294730321369931
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	15920649.503772343
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased .	34.810719175694054
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh !	20.45897979564832
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	85.96465518647695
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	8896.379959339143
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane .	2471.8587707229535
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	5.134191893240716
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	19.005880162461267
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	283799.75826549064
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and , before she could reply , he added , it is above eight months .	4906323.854541656
we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield .	70.90417883283394
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at longbourn .	8830.844856795937
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	966.0273948264886
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	558592397.5221237
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	21036409402.707104
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .	1706962120.7377403
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country .	950852.9340024471
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	78.80367416292546
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .	2714.6309227926604
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	1342316.6402867087
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends .	4375.329322063759
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	14989319.92365604
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	6572.394465590894
but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .	129.94604504331193
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	3571.1467411577805
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	11.198998426355383
of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	899.4731910177169
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr. darcy .	241119.84062075918
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	90285.11958765626
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	76.29447834287757
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	9849.469371181305
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	76.14671900564487
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged .	5856649.19477557
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	1535901.6765433922
she certainly did not hate him .	2.646167731750809
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	1552.0055461909787
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	15864138.579499373
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	218.321936463189
it was gratitude .	1.2298245131118815
-- gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	17419.86931258901
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	35575621.99822538
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	1491364.5106997606
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	85972161.94132563
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .	7787441592.984237
they were , therefore , to go .	3.582626766082946
-- elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	394.4030400783655
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	5.136072459737312
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon .	386.1673951573901
chapter iii.	1
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	767802.412710607
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	186.6187477442658
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	2065.8391846484596
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london .	1817.0513248553516
georgiana's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	81671.96665813382
mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	26.419177234136644
by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	5310.827590314529
it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	1618741.6889492183
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	3159.8711119184522
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .	2041.93199395492
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	22638.542093432545
her own thoughts were employing her .	2.5289966368631953
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	15.224929314641141
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	822.2117981617196
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	3534.8004514651466
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	13.573891406139165
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	2659102.836810052
there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	11358.905023583113
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	3283208.301682141
he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .	220386.59839187545
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; -- a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	117350219.34943622
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .	163627.05156393652
miss darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	189533.12108118465
miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility ,	394.481180541862
pray , miss eliza , are not the ---- shire militia removed from meryton ?	21.283776619476598
they must be a great loss to your family .	7.436290842763498
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	290761.4539853814
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	1598.48286735484
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	2618608484.0824614
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement .	15.163994859276178
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	311194.80142859014
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	31273.546981585332
elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	13169.850343086764
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	92680.04842231992
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	15067.200497934396
but georgiana would not join her .	2.592827166755928
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	16742.15491275948
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	414.732454498998
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy she cried ; i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	2875.8524523951187
she is grown so brown and coarse !	2.3420890021516247
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again .	28.14299330871997
however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , -- no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	11550.467060411773
for my own part she rejoined , i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .	144.2145638351655
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .	97.11523254229465
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .	11.415498113293769
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	11183.806076351102
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .	1547.5068833234654
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	57886.32218186513
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued ,	51.464633787709765
i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' she a beauty !	94593.74419297036
-- i should as soon call her mother a wit .'	8.566447373203111
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	111.19259317782605
yes replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .	37047.44272924898
he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	1022.3644520112547
mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	745.6459951400768
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	326.23808719731767
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him , and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	247372.7593243697
chapter iv.	1
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	974767589.3904408
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	35.8417576188464
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	2170.4214129212482
the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago .	35.77312042406067
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	34471.32696530377
it was to this effect	1.7424450996107512
since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well .	4018.739004575728
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .	6.593926495062043
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham !	113881.15600473162
-- imagine our surprise .	1.5165469357250003
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	9.347380318253567
i am very , very sorry .	2.7908799530026807
so imprudent a match on both sides !	3.342118377851608
-- but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	53.74496159014861
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	333.69544789516686
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	81.61448059803409
our poor mother is sadly grieved .	2.68015613570136
my father bears it better .	1.9201001219684686
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .	380.9660095978967
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	127.9401910436659
the express was sent off directly .	2.2991950281310607
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	20.37583182512135
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	7.504654024215956
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	23.779327337390082
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother .	25.86594045588936
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written .	166.48744376045104
without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	365036.61076477944
by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent .	60001.26634717513
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	267.2346585314992
imprudent as a marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland .	61278.75478036747
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	120.24983196761399
though lydia's short letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w. never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b. intending to trace their route .	4747630.6245717965
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom .	1458.4294101003018
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road .	54.086287494427964
i know not what to think .	3.183553524006724
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f. came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	190043.33432824124
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	255.61193437405163
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f. but no one can throw any blame on them .	70.10359351981869
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great .	8.019294699154756
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him .	42.50009452238822
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ?	870492.2762353091
-- impossible .	1
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w. was not a man to be trusted .	17300.30934501656
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	9.322707361475247
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected .	3834.8528982845487
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	125.19593985233719
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ?	12248.168510474963
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	22.551356074149023
adieu .	1
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	25671.272259465368
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former .	2366.535554943391
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her .	49.517135947128175
what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening .	53151.87491538678
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness .	2179.540090445639
oh !	1
where , where is my uncle ?	3.636686723974946
cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr. darcy appeared .	144824.2496913104
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , i beg your pardon , but i must leave you .	120777.68825544896
i must find mr. gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose .	311.3733423126241
good god !	1
what is the matter ?	2.0064213932684107
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr. and mrs. gardiner .	8317.035423161062
you are not well enough ; -- you cannot go yourself .	13.504889960999702
elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	205.78339430134093
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .	1843.488212706064
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , let me call your maid .	209256.95490133425
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?	15.147024941095884
-- a glass of wine ; -- shall i get you one ?	12.052354870024407
-- you are very ill .	2.5161400465616643
no , i thank you she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	8.973978902187854
there is nothing the matter with me .	2.917835793641281
i am quite well .	1.686793594285546
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn .	44.163025139260554
she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	126.40179727364215
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	131.71938161547192
at length , she spoke again .	3.1945553775602464
i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .	21.728739060843854
it cannot be concealed from any one .	3.8518079496709077
my youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; -- has thrown herself into the power of -- of mr. wickham .	321.7651417429408
they are gone off together from brighton .	4.1550860583612685
you know him too well to doubt the rest .	8.597888768996338
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever .	121.1455794481055
darcy was fixed in astonishment .	2.2394719037262436
when i consider she added , in a yet more agitated voice , that i might have prevented it !	50.508426671859496
-- i who knew what he was .	4.2780617338083395
had i but explained some part of it only -- some part of what i learnt , to my own family !	150.87211460087363
had his character been known , this could not have happened .	10.858194685272705
but it is all , all too late now .	7.033345529862699
i am grieved , indeed cried darcy ; grieved -- shocked .	11.036634264211703
but is it certain , absolutely certain ?	4.232022017949469
oh yes !	1
-- they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland .	665.391802138677
and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?	27.277841551663652
my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour .	4517.155411622382
but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done .	56.26240649824707
how is such a man to be worked on ?	5.672642007458604
how are they even to be discovered ?	5.132397696950498
i have not the smallest hope .	3.1675118025608238
it is every way horrible !	1.8662703247802745
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	2.8464874924098322
when my eyes were opened to his real character .	6.6122096384581415
-- oh !	1
had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do !	24.649888377011646
but i knew not -- i was afraid of doing too much .	23.338079602002615
wretched , wretched , mistake !	1.973245965170384
darcy made no answer .	1.58358876292269
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	324.26581031495147
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	4.952383534912538
her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	246.17795372190366
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	214.79640512871572
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	24655.768730468022
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	9.177160666799134
lydia -- the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	9644368352420.396
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .	195.3021093911973
-- but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	101.349589023
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day .	132.4725092338106
oh , yes .	1.3762319573743051
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy .	8.32481230159761
say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	3.1348175913640155
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	8.065289517539986
-- i know it cannot be long .	4.139652582202152
he readily assured her of his secrecy -- again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	293742.3358035693
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	153002404.34964764
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	84.76877066725494
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	2757613521.1205096
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	4503.913204260359
never , since reading jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her .	111.58690731510009
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	47.794195131160954
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	13.180492228566683
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	213915.7353443019
but now it was all too natural .	3.4881599947983823
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	624533.1358640951
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	10937.999161132231
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	128.9593699670383
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	12.137277161466725
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .	8.138171954749591
-- oh !	1
how acutely did she now feel it .	3.818112846513407
she was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	21961973766.238644
mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; -- but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .	2688699.8022934236
-- though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	175.0702860417985
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr. gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	2449.200165214615
-- elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	2510.3607109784584
they were to be off as soon as possible .	5.359545734022662
but what is to be done about pemberley ?	5.329192654992449
cried mrs. gardiner .	1.4280404459731006
john told us mr. darcy was here when you sent for us ; -- was it so ?	66.82386636664204
yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	21.64309965730021
that is all settled .	2.0498666890914063
that is all settled repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	51.057480636069194
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	23.625728652957008
oh , that i knew how it was !	5.121949123208623
but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	237.19729474158623
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	13291110.436620327
an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .	43498969.80810452
chapter v.	1
i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	153719.02246397396
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .	93939.56629835979
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	10.831196112335112
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ?	87.79691158578683
his temptation is not adequate to the risk .	4.361611422675854
do you really think so ?	2.450921112974877
cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	4.27777125923236
upon my word said mrs. gardiner , i begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	32.580602199236736
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	194.70052172785125
i cannot think so very ill of wickham .	6.0069069005102
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?	142.48744231670668
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	3.409726294562536
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .	9.507599504795365
if , indeed , it should be so !	5.079643641065664
but i dare not hope it .	3.934642945088728
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ?	69.62752849607025
in the first place replied mr. gardiner , there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland .	95.50255970063326
oh !	1
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	12.01645124501307
and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road .	42.78154358204133
well , then -- supposing them to be in london .	11.313709847417524
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .	53.316372946385684
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland .	6025.004371601578
but why all this secrecy ?	1.903314749512012
why any fear of detection ?	1.888612839561347
why must their marriage be private ?	2.6211064552508563
oh !	1
no , no , this is not likely .	7.095988327925162
his most particular friend , you see by jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	197.378326545907
wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	6.716177007515344
he cannot afford it .	1.4884380809115147
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	8520.852135480278
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	10201.104064645777
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .	32.13846197238623
lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .	43029574.744934864
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?	2025.7801118435661
it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	2995.3870173489995
but , really , i know not what to say .	10.759679148737419
perhaps i am not doing her justice .	3.3069214023260747
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	53495.16197797041
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	480.5283181588135
since the ---- shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	318.9907921299369
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall i call it ?	665.7104191157534
susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .	10.111844542631717
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .	81.12915281888544
but you see that jane said her aunt , does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	614.9059671587802
of whom does jane ever think ill ?	3.2481433417519328
and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	1214.7928686687699
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is .	24.154572522454142
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .	25.41456512830711
that he has neither integrity nor honour .	3.0925624799350278
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating .	10.441032894245854
and do you really know all this ?	4.569016317618036
cried mrs. gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	26.05053165211229
i do , indeed replied elizabeth , colouring .	3.428131129601592
i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	120801.45193563215
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .	1815.2153382373042
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	164.01192107552308
yet he knew to the contrary himself .	4.370287323405714
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .	38.2366661615713
but does lydia know nothing of this ?	3.5517563540835293
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ?	36.130474149854706
oh , yes !	1.3053693132800441
-- that , that is the worst of all .	9.216505576489071
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .	1627.0009886057833
and when i returned home , the ---- shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time .	76.47318418290254
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	2448923.7223896612
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	1204.3973946439644
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	21.09775289341753
that such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts .	61.248581345562044
when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	346.3031464371741
not the slightest .	1.2903388475030186
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	13200.483161968568
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .	124.03113185531633
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .	47502310.415190354
it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	334384.9871303497
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	3.5223950003353757
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	80.17398663461857
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	189.2296531111053
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	54.42675764193792
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	10869532.747503437
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	4840.120872957031
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	1062.8836131647313
not yet replied jane .	1.7001026213796975
but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well .	54.76310791801703
is my father in town ?	2.450942064410016
yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word .	13.794224523049866
and have you heard from him often ?	5.734376323269197
we have heard only once .	2.3367076897427994
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do .	2806.592529886876
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	121.67160716707262
and my mother -- how is she ?	4.232911883790033
how are you all ?	1.998235004836154
my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .	31.259659035865234
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	35.9957415636343
she does not yet leave her dressing-room .	3.7085355252351215
mary and kitty , thank heaven !	2.6510848056482175
are quite well .	1.2265231509901544
but you -- how are you ?	3.5423273368499113
cried elizabeth .	1
you look pale .	1.208784785829063
how much you must have gone through !	4.355828753372469
her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	47973.518232274364
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	116.04793613159576
when they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give .	18368.63926140826
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	1168533.324398134
mrs. bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	27442860.97838926
if i had been able said she , to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her .	36784.03925458726
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	13.833179271637063
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	11471.241270595214
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over-ruled , as i always am .	214.04287552200017
poor dear child !	1.223355791602348
and now here's mr. bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	3849.263496733681
the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do .	7524.225052986191
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr. gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .	367977.6245697051
do not give way to useless alarm added he , though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	3508.4676715994983
it is not quite a week since they left brighton .	10.162120242336433
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	82522.44380894284
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done .	57404.07013845642
oh !	1
my dear brother replied mrs. bennet , that is exactly what i could most wish for .	41.47729392547996
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry .	2959.205223982416
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	23548.997767556684
and , above all things , keep mr. bennet from fighting .	10.142350050905966
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , -- that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day .	2980748.5116627133
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	3621.4036393789493
oh , brother , how kind you are !	4.823343152851562
i know you will contrive it all .	3.9586953896223562
but mr. gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	116352883.82467872
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	959583230.3362857
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	1090.697556170699
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	10.206044077754877
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty .	1057309.4125729178
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table ,	1139.824873769374
this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of .	31.49281466398541
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation .	117.1028235191386
then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable -- that one false step involves her in endless ruin -- that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , -- and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .	750542995.3391492
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	73.68536070888125
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	53.34276842820767
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy .	13983.631420081043
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard .	5081474.79528221
give me farther particulars .	1.7755228736573305
what did colonel forster say ?	1.942483676046208
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	13.028726238523758
they must have seen them together for ever .	6.5597588029471945
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	275.2574930183968
i am so grieved for him .	3.1561275538408253
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	8.36600272023748
he was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	18808.452210903964
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ?	7.488150003604329
did he know of their intending to go off ?	6.614128170269742
had colonel forster seen denny himself ?	2.652809812683965
yes ; but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	396.72688243121866
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying -- and from that i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .	432.1528859866922
and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ?	327.4699204209628
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	14.80447178841186
i felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	2749.234622832965
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .	87.85106059395105
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	1983.4865479261782
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks .	72.85010704592202
but not before they went to brighton ?	5.109468391591386
no , i believe not .	1.9442005214113138
and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ?	8.367450623286683
does he know his real character ?	2.8007164886584746
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .	56.66833800712032
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	3.7502588505832133
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false .	448.78110493476424
oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !	321.32201551751155
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister .	5.905399407855751
but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	144.94102376942314
we acted with the best intentions .	2.839812789632073
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife ?	14.042045083319431
he brought it with him for us to see .	8.490589657508758
jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to elizabeth .	25.107271104571417
these were the contents	1.4053123265800906
my dear harriet ,	1.1764458705088028
you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as i am missed .	1392.2891642430902
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .	17408.615527606027
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	79.02988834916543
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham .	32525.336188809713
what a good joke it will be !	3.6082834368225507
i can hardly write for laughing .	2.8669708371261784
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .	50.70817743654576
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	8096.839771263189
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	6230.013662283369
good bye .	1
give my love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey .	48.97631953348372
your affectionate friend ,	1.2023210006177019
lydia bennet.	1
oh !	1
thoughtless , thoughtless lydia !	1.4851480452616894
cried elizabeth when she had finished it .	3.8145363882168737
what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	18.229460660242236
but at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	33.353778137391785
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .	65.93887858732748
my poor father !	1.2374366338659673
how he must have felt it !	3.466365645250615
i never saw any one so shocked .	4.356434421163126
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	7.851142409745306
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !	20.235539641922827
oh !	1
jane cried elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	389.6095759679419
i do not know .	1.8241433583000373
-- i hope there was .	2.8546681371320273
-- but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	22.659157415557846
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !	5270.739286432129
but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties .	23.421752841486523
your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	15.317758688691148
you do not look well .	1.8564359397204018
oh !	1
that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone .	48.64041198898296
mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them .	2605.5472974238855
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	152.11780403423055
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me .	1233.7066743869598
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us .	741367.9664589681
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth ; perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	4541.923623148905
assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable .	2.967427963286667
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied .	18.628886646078822
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	586.5876392016135
he meant , i believe replied jane , to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	6543.542114692013
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .	91.92832176219682
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham .	9749.30397206793
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	45155.440042387556
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .	37957.61262673049
chapter vi.	1
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	2090.9809119848514
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	869.6569754963398
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .	735.8816852512773
mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	13.814796244018057
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	96687261.18220969
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	1186.7922777309786
she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	175.92790923118267
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	337249.67236455175
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .	160.91101873488154
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	930.4026753712068
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	2091.8140894630283
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	1331100440.039101
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street .	91775.27011484293
that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings .	13107289.182362301
mr. gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	942.2996653317596
he added , that mr. bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon .	322.2317631139183
there was also a postscript to this effect .	4.863538927852185
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	786438.4655707931
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	1234.6514855974967
at present we have nothing to guide us .	4.119380667650804
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	161.6100353650361
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person .	511.6823725797959
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	15896.594135483123
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	776.0744833195296
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ---- shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	38186.84716530316
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	645.3315728207164
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	15.895991924658395
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	2002.8534651061996
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr. collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	97978759.26361017
it was as follows	1.3936198911269573
my dear sir ,	1.320784727610068
i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .	22683.93530924652
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	164007.3916616869
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	11995.86469981121
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	25.903143953511897
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	3173529068.5884233
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair .	17446.109996190808
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	28295.518843444097
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	7197.141790816433
let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	29134.095347093105
i am , dear sir , &c .	2.8600048275457484
&c .	1
mr. gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	1434.2634653446821
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	2080.5621177850894
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	3650.3917408360503
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	95.40712964574216
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	58500.93173702256
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton .	65.17395683659555
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	90.71927773536486
mr. gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror .	85.76113579582703
a gamester !	1
she cried .	1
this is wholly unexpected .	1.5197381330018933
i had not an idea of it .	4.098830577693201
mr. gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .	788.0562601594531
rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	53981.974832478125
when mrs. bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	2307.175813655842
what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia !	12.506975055027722
she cried .	1
sure he will not leave london before he has found them .	13.997022476860831
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?	37.95064256880665
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr. bennet came from it .	5947.45475464293
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .	146.3728697947608
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	380.0426737219048
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	19548.862753908696
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley .	13.856599613593602
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better .	40648672.64800332
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	27.870097636300045
when mr. bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	20.07451385124175
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	80757.19811514922
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , say nothing of that .	76560.10099767536
who should suffer but myself ?	2.2142175042261334
it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it .	20.259032487423212
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth .	9.344495181664616
you may well warn me against such an evil .	6.875407897394848
human nature is so prone to fall into it !	6.682576063278684
no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .	64.9146553823566
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	7.586101364129329
it will pass away soon enough .	2.71270548885447
do you suppose them to be in london ?	5.526041190462411
yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ?	8.354329787828325
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty .	9.817741679665032
she is happy , then said her father , drily ; and her residence there will probably be of some duration .	153.16366700933867
then , after a short silence , he continued , lizzy , i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind .	32309.99207064881
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	25.379128336173704
this is a parade cried he , which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	80.49826009564859
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can , -- or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away .	173957.94192717213
i am not going to run away , papa said kitty , fretfully ; if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia .	956.1512383499226
you go to brighton !	1.9490635632937072
-- i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds !	28.184306302790176
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	171.23728319097162
no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .	64.28529776005185
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	18.28336230274415
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner .	1620.4867255932768
kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	30.484987002235115
well , well said he , do not make yourself unhappy .	10.750687264370288
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them .	411.333987965643
chapter vii.	1
two days after mr. bennet's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask .	298997461479.7783
what do you mean , hill ?	3.293321180062125
we have heard nothing from town .	3.1134385352287413
dear madam cried mrs. hill , in great astonishment , don't you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ?	349.0563859212112
he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter .	24.736636906272526
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	45.12713392811782
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library ; -- their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said ,	189825.96551856707
if you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse .	51.53104539213679
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	11300.439927129211
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out ,	15772.06958678963
oh , papa , what news ?	3.1136072338099114
what news ?	1
have you heard from my uncle ?	4.00621070421973
yes , i have had a letter from him by express .	15.734236495550151
well , and what news does it bring ?	4.612402034022128
good or bad ?	1.4441494376475719
what is there of good to be expected ?	6.173206792562288
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; but perhaps you would like to read it .	92.39608880810123
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	3.4132699810981277
jane now came up .	1.6822659507778956
read it aloud said their father , for i hardly know myself what it is about .	33.697502426499504
gracechurch-street , monday ,	1.2304917838523461
august 2 .	1
my dear brother ,	1.4354898777869958
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction .	1700.2034113229115
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were .	205.70058132538253
the particulars , i reserve till we meet .	5.349398462871267
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both ----	38.24384275950033
then it is , as i always hoped cried jane ; they are married !	32.81777906316724
elizabeth read on ; i have seen them both .	10.307482600088845
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are .	260075.27932034805
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	6683056.650748666
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you .	817.5985807941079
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	73.28072682624669
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr. wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	444.9399435931131
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	128006.90181097359
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .	14412.51442698456
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .	1057.425005557598
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	35.05339391498941
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .	383.6467698347116
she comes to us to-day .	2.2323671813587556
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .	15.680687142791085
your's , &c .	1.0024385476315292
edw. gardiner.	1
is it possible !	1.38466167394295
cried elizabeth , when she had finished .	4.7074581809148865
can it be possible that he will marry her ?	7.154946574128314
wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him said her sister .	65.10745527808066
my dear father , i congratulate you .	3.8913808793080564
and have you answered the letter ?	3.2995088174308616
said elizabeth .	1
no ; but it must be done soon .	5.342061618671777
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	36.202737731747575
oh !	1
my dear father she cried , come back , and write immediately .	17.855919791949283
consider how important every moment is , in such a case .	12.73249450618984
let me write for you said jane , if you dislike the trouble yourself .	24.91712135322977
i dislike it very much he replied ; but it must be done .	25.87043204126048
and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	42.94877305149092
and may i ask ?	1.8267571659548711
said elizabeth , but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with .	18.594908203671213
complied with !	1
i am only ashamed of his asking so little .	7.3848554597848475
and they must marry !	1.9976730535444107
yet he is such a man !	2.6748861557877786
yes , yes , they must marry .	5.484058754487135
there is nothing else to be done .	4.570759679966605
but there are two things that i want very much to know -- one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how i am ever to pay him .	81206.14755005534
money !	1
my uncle !	1
cried jane , what do you mean , sir ?	8.981951604945321
i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after i am gone .	4032.1216443347935
that is very true said elizabeth ; though it had not occurred to me before .	51.1658603590321
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	11.242337644604381
oh !	1
it must be my uncle's doings !	2.657524257345712
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself .	12.245830746733663
a small sum could not do all this .	5.304635269732634
no said her father , wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	91.34024281466117
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship .	90.50033724745211
ten thousand pounds !	1.2820636537332115
heaven forbid !	1
how is half such a sum to be repaid ?	6.013050298438342
mr. bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	96.05521285907224
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	71.15145376971695
and they are really to be married !	4.823788832190657
cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	5.907206489739798
how strange this is !	1.7340321656607167
and for this we are to be thankful .	5.672260519314575
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	548.4592449641328
oh , lydia !	1.3852829278811836
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane , that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	525.5516854159126
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	1138.8358534927004
he has children of his own , and may have more .	14.271936649115702
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?	3.776307684423921
if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been said elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .	199113.59845772412
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	7.254134263894538
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	788.8974226187926
by this time she is actually with them !	5.3238145069663645
if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	63.82550037448832
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !	12.49123854526125
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy .	172.82085038006605
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	363.6677305654335
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten .	2517.6708061318154
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth , as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget .	185.82484373819224
it is useless to talk of it .	4.496953012911333
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	161.0570380082314
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	678.2206483395881
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied ,	14.937838856704879
just as you please .	2.025001559477453
may we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	9.335604102823604
take whatever you like , and get away .	4.218698792804414
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	28.342307355722426
mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all .	63.15098414097862
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	20.705370553168862
mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself .	3.1671151332143612
as soon as jane had read mr. gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	761.2645048916769
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	103.68495608778576
to know that her daughter would be married was enough .	12.321626970249095
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	57.031982447804694
my dear , dear lydia !	2.3544137581198514
she cried this is delightful indeed !	2.627659265781647
-- she will be married !	2.53564334309146
-- i shall see her again !	3.3065089070407456
-- she will be married at sixteen !	4.136290795698758
-- my good , kind brother !	3.0504128172766065
-- i knew how it would be -- i knew he would manage every thing .	33.684036588038865
how i long to see her !	1.9621897610443204
and to see dear wickham too !	3.2175801509392854
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !	4.55094155384483
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .	9.874827608732687
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	185.30411418915838
stay , stay , i will go myself .	5.318668740215393
ring the bell , kitty , for hill .	5.461365409508447
i will put on my things in a moment .	6.901398515221649
my dear , dear lydia !	2.3544137581198514
-- how merry we shall be together when we meet !	7.635410522408594
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	1248.8849117471755
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added , in a great measure , to his kindness .	48.48147221415232
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money .	23.782143008875423
well cried her mother , it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?	92.99841821336878
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	171317.84769744184
well !	1
i am so happy .	1.8786443501176346
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married .	18.216726114898005
mrs. wickham !	1
how well it sounds .	1.3892426162011702
and she was only sixteen last june .	2.6703927476488714
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me .	907.5894571122199
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately .	56.9683873670074
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	174807.72288661383
one day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	575.8238706758666
other schemes too came into her head .	3.762074617688524
i will go to meryton said she , as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips .	947.9139516251437
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long .	47.70045691569467
kitty , run down and order the carriage .	4.754319551332188
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure .	31.272235172982846
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ?	18.376692899527633
oh !	1
here comes hill .	1.208185964351008
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ?	9.691541700092317
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding .	254.8555066928467
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy .	4.479283546054321
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	854.6090227194542
poor lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	440.27237543014473
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	640502.9945357712
chapter viii.	1
mr. bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	113983.58564556143
he now wished it more than ever .	4.298197301584739
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	3086.31414359252
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	555.6758245686257
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	1294892.9484092793
when first mr. bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son .	810.5082131409259
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	2342.9099353596466
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs. bennet , for many years after lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	2389.373746723822
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	65.84454873939208
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	80.20913467351828
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children .	31.044984775576953
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	75.58503454594462
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	4460.351263209475
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	32490.137770215926
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	5012.219135720934
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	411759.2087337652
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	32431.155330806356
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	379.2768527760429
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	60.237140653115894
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her .	1948.6741696800157
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	25.631211508015383
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	5.354326000108404
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	24781.01323510011
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	2690242.6302787247
it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	6221.0082803575415
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	6.874041581427701
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	568195.4545629642
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	4791.78441091148
haye-park might do said she , if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off !	1912.1648617969747
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful .	151.82543281403716
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	23.20357270584829
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , mrs. bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	19800.116352021683
into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	13.774299373950898
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn .	24.9064877962528
a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr. bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and mrs. bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	28968.127747081777
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	71.88912018771168
mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it .	3.0573756380138883
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	7624.861691816966
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	25529.563242069027
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	30666830.630084082
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	12.211449565632652
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	6991.383561497429
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	489.42603615342927
had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	739739.5153788594
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	9.2465323473346
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	1086.4370475538678
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	47.60250869604723
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	66.553932872053
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	65.25918243720213
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet .	239.2839679913821
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	4823.755729180373
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	45.51620152021932
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .	8.89515765577839
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	224.80583427624506
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	79.67942581599176
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	691079.6274640341
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	20.556128520152974
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	200.97119448923655
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	43.915869993391205
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	711.648149723367
mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	4.957200132660085
to mr. bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	14882.461397584686
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .	217.98589420257136
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	86.2281365286721
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	806.397204002039
it is mr. wickham's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	3110.8606997650654
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ---- 's regiment , now quartered in the north .	56.7304162087321
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .	44.25754219112857
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	645.3625315271044
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself .	64326.69884260587
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	663.0848935122923
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us .	76.07984612550673
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	16.055787387123765
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs. gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south .	17964.896454010042
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .	28.746871291882442
-- your's , &c .	1.2968392969736544
e. gardiner.	1
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the ---- shire , as clearly as mr. gardiner could do .	476.8714252433547
but mrs. bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	10.939375892093897
lydia's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	85850532.12897019
she is so fond of mrs. forster said she , it will be quite shocking to send her away !	100.95824181102039
and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	48.26221226869829
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ---- 's regiment .	10.415860859824043
his daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative .	7299.9918907515475
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	185011078.6415603
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north .	1556.994076415637
when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn .	12489.37076556512
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	11342.831130018069
chapter ix.	1
their sister's wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	148.10274692716303
the carriage was sent to meet them at ---- , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	153.63837131052367
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	65212.76932233697
they came .	1
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	21.245688154561222
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	2339.4850977359583
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	140.3121323402728
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	52244.608373929295
their reception from mr. bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	51.91969478366999
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .	11.330382283043662
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	24.610703535400738
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked .	6.65602746510852
lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	13.502124012178928
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	622579.0238695007
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	535072.7829337253
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	3352.693038229538
she blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	122.54950580131566
there was no want of discourse .	2.2744755107975405
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	249383.25821424183
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	16.26372609300532
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	795.5759164078524
only think of its being three months she cried , since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	8079.991418848166
good gracious !	1
when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again !	294.07603749975783
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was .	17.196660113748624
her father lifted up his eyes .	2.681196797498871
jane was distressed .	1.1378939527401744
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , oh !	631.0936922101846
mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to-day ?	12.743142515319148
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing .	61547652.954909034
elizabeth could bear it no longer .	3.222452097100849
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	1278.7051926376294
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , ah !	2987.4819212233706
jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman .	129.64317796096935
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	237.08998623209573
her ease and good spirits increased .	3.4754199060584847
she longed to see mrs. philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called mrs. wickham by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs. hill and the two housemaids .	2286403.339201925
well , mamma said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	264.80326236267973
is not he a charming man ?	3.3068159530494836
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .	4.827327467222837
i only hope they may have half my good luck .	10.777965105954125
they must all go to brighton .	3.419464608701116
that is the place to get husbands .	5.1473759162535595
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go .	24.20296244960092
very true ; and if i had my will , we should .	16.817870932770877
but my dear lydia , i don't at all like your going such a way off .	61.20290745619511
must it be so ?	1.9456151401629809
oh , lord !	1.131938641577127
yes ; -- there is nothing in that .	6.4944179641370665
i shall like it of all things .	4.820293437412724
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	31.89420305518876
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all .	1307.3180642774269
i should like it beyond any thing !	3.5634748256026016
said her mother .	1.333359520069155
and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	4648.441777295061
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth ; but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	263.7033757695919
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	11.864226757686625
mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	560.8320940102449
no one but mrs. bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	11228.565775786185
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	1692.335888788076
wickham's affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia's for him .	194.46214509241494
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	37709690528.26399
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	2.735284821821779
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .	133.93139080491108
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .	1803.4863021745236
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth ,	372.79559036767716
lizzy , i never gave you an account of my wedding , i believe .	18.770156274919724
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it .	49.09830535217505
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?	7.751504341044858
no really replied elizabeth ; i think there cannot be too little said on the subject .	57.725904090853476
la !	1
you are so strange !	1.7439322288871184
but i must tell you how it went off .	5.440764998159118
we were married , you know , at st .	5.996898616618891
clement's , because wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	6.588547990771948
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	16.96766915798448
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .	150.6048549388046
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !	11.494194604023193
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .	373.25792597882156
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	439.5399974866016
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .	394.14443625217365
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	25.502935089958275
well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .	99337.74477290774
if you'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .	181.73901263549982
not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	11.081328426512883
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open .	29.16927887441875
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone .	699.5484690251745
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	86.66454909811472
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	20298.911266821553
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	109.00202397302851
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well .	3108.1162267742234
mr. darcy !	1
repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .	3.105474293314122
oh , yes !	1.3053693132800441
-- he was to come there with wickham , you know .	17.285836855098744
but gracious me !	1.2377750743356195
i quite forgot !	1.2083202959184127
i ought not to have said a word about it .	7.433233678016723
i promised them so faithfully !	1.8682289908722354
what will wickham say ?	1.530624152787135
it was to be such a secret !	4.343800138032587
if it was to be secret said jane , say not another word on the subject .	38.404592667490306
you may depend upon my seeking no further .	4.180681064928032
oh !	1
certainly said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; we will ask you no questions .	21.067778796923008
thank you said lydia , for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry .	297.297600775131
on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	143.14039134770408
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	351.49267115565306
mr. darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	6.340009397224684
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	419.87162028610254
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .	162.00009447090483
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	46.43817242717189
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	25241.964559756867
you may readily comprehend she added , what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	81308.19091220638
pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance .	32684.750351184382
not that i shall though she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .	56711.11250720479
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	125662.35877790092
chapter x.	1
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	47.38073136225332
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	980497.8769056919
gracechurch-street , sept .	1.1197562001281314
6 .	1
my dear niece ,	1.1567290463225046
i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .	3221.112270591504
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you .	51.773533525712445
don't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .	1083.2833932269757
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	10.16335779585592
your uncle is as much surprised as i am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	4956.504945780948
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .	26.5706099822748
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	139.4632428420719
mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	13.71264930907633
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	151.5687075995104
he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once .	9313.485246594062
from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .	828.1940655703157
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	41885.11451613506
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	1156.509327244619
his character was to speak for itself .	4.595343351791843
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	444.69946730788774
if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .	17.884113046339415
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	195538.06400633047
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	19853.904424107455
she then took a large house in edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	48.929198924278275
this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	1590.3467274887817
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	46.1805015818804
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	413.7540129073435
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	10312.476159114767
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	7.218770599256676
they were in ---- street .	1.919096242360817
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .	6.371903356579337
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	203766.3538642867
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	9.787054013375123
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .	197.51514553371555
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	81.999175302285
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .	52871.76235301204
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	14897.686967273092
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	155.73171646473284
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	182.25449691429205
mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	20.242465825940478
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	2164.193074978164
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	1745.8108479002276
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	36.40115115361634
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	17.375320639140497
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	92.17094493469598
every thing being settled between them mr. darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch-street the evening before i came home .	1913.0746459365137
but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	3819.528557711065
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	4592.98187934723
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	445.3558498188084
on saturday he came again .	2.2600294645815673
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	683.9243077914929
they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too .	19.952142323178887
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .	78.41671897910234
but our visitor was very obstinate .	2.551032437480802
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	46.342964454928406
he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .	47.83751769103382
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	24815.848631065266
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	235.02852518894088
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	352810319.37143576
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .	43.110617209785204
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .	47.15443489123769
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased .	5793.310851972168
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .	124.31051082920817
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	8002.3523257256875
perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody's reserve , can be answerable for the event .	359.3253207616862
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	22951.523592734797
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	725372.5913894748
i believe i have now told you every thing .	7.070075339410113
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	736.3070681466753
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .	25.477338717088323
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	307559358.5013766
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	3446.515830046069
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .	83.46899778516674
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	346.3068214150281
mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	56.003741383618014
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .	89.99919652473804
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .	3721.198390765777
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .	168.30944622028272
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him .	924.6281708456193
i thought him very sly ; -- he hardly ever mentioned your name .	22.314695222180323
but slyness seems the fashion .	1.7963604074587336
pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .	24450.676819976128
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	38.33918651700386
but i must write no more .	3.0640359483162265
the children have been wanting me this half hour .	5.711041812398111
your's , very sincerely ,	1.8596780250502702
m. gardiner.	1
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	1112.7294029019274
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	16584709.255038599
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	908195871.0751121
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	29.293979479698645
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	15.184780826030925
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .	752497.7191591038
brother-in-law of wickham !	1.3961395267916632
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	6.496403551531256
he had to be sure done much .	3.503211076226077
she was ashamed to think how much .	4.184683258945578
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	50.32825042266726
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	13471706.592956837
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	364.6856497218805
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him .	32.429732360012714
oh !	1
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	126.5970809891215
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .	15.010781525606093
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	158.90717400198363
she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	11.560192295177773
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .	5.653205044422121
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself .	7790.538668466766
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham .	942.9129215244187
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?	10.075036658626239
said he , as he joined her .	3.6912812478196404
you certainly do she replied with a smile ; but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .	84.24008665460678
i should be sorry indeed , if it were .	8.114107771305518
we were always good friends ; and now we are better .	15.234829306151159
true .	1
are the others coming out ?	2.368466180939524
i do not know .	1.8241433583000373
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .	14.846422783609961
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley .	128.86274881852032
she replied in the affirmative .	2.435769928296042
i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .	2853.225979996536
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ?	7.401516327224909
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	7.681337585378573
but of course she did not mention my name to you .	11.830118566396322
yes , she did .	1.6979463813640547
and what did she say ?	2.313076360101931
that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well .	56.91785245206577
at such a distance as that you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	16.11494676391444
certainly he replied , biting his lips .	2.5307208379834334
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said ,	12.410649516808324
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .	10.278485882502133
we passed each other several times .	2.690854499954679
i wonder what he can be doing there .	4.968370006780967
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth .	8.059951489663826
it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year .	39.383292410050785
undoubtedly .	1
did you see him while you were at lambton ?	8.84840129991752
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had .	11.267238184840787
yes ; he introduced us to his sister .	5.844106933311167
and do you like her ?	2.6119300727510133
very much .	1
i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	27.789428638608356
when i last saw her , she was not very promising .	10.798879378103571
i am very glad you liked her .	5.437890120167684
i hope she will turn out well .	3.3134181857587452
i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age .	34.334242776196
did you go by the village of kympton ?	5.0566823707239275
i do not recollect that we did .	3.0640900034446017
i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had .	67.09086920074195
a most delightful place !	1.788351584349646
-- excellent parsonage house !	1.525743758087561
it would have suited me in every respect .	4.150467727421848
how should you have liked making sermons ?	4.150734289862976
exceedingly well .	1
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	61.9728531208104
one ought not to repine ; -- but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	205.07235959318572
the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	98.76557856562468
but it was not to be .	2.18502526288564
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ?	28.835406800227005
i have heard from authority , which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron .	687.8681509174523
you have .	1
yes , there was something in that i told you so from the first , you may remember .	144.4856942700466
i did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly .	173202.22983632595
you did !	1
and it was not wholly without foundation .	2.8328329320091536
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it .	97.66806318671998
they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile ,	59995.83381035868
come , mr. wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	27.017988893788722
do not let us quarrel about the past .	5.784763536956628
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind .	14.949144871367944
she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	660.2842446239076
chapter xi.	1
mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	156222.69716387417
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came , and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	89842.92306213718
oh !	1
my dear lydia she cried , when shall we meet again ?	15.817717930551689
oh , lord !	1.131938641577127
i don't know .	1.2289273764764588
not these two or three years perhaps .	2.765965849991013
write to me very often , my dear .	5.3960907081109255
as often as i can .	2.8900381204268917
but you know married women have never much time for writing .	9.76416387921369
my sisters may write to me .	2.9664439499049515
they will have nothing else to do .	4.973806170878605
mr. wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	7.849816428635922
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	10.144678235724905
he is as fine a fellow said mr. bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , as ever i saw .	241.59874371728378
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	13.042287037587474
i am prodigiously proud of him .	2.367753689919071
i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law .	24.98637192319907
the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days .	16.493363982798364
i often think said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	40.18470809869401
one seems so forlorn without them .	2.0940169878434474
this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter said elizabeth .	42.31645932398389
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single .	15.212054060762084
it is no such thing .	2.0901243044541298
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	273.04140986322324
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .	19.551906095097053
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	12652.951755847707
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	2909.8174727195274
mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets .	3.590266087894349
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	14.597977462750109
well , well , and so mr. bingley is coming down , sister ( for mrs. philips first brought her the news .	358.3412920317986
) well , so much the better .	4.2116326601079255
not that i care about it , though .	5.036990263820241
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again .	222.64839026051135
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it .	52.60340007287547
and who knows what may happen ?	2.4794410751415965
but that is nothing to us .	3.6132306908019114
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	45.18328631449233
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ?	12.423022470313501
you may depend on it replied the other , for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .	149676.23926382946
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday .	16.081683185383685
she was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed .	5947.75834567906
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	31.519722560184796
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said ,	857.9107103458437
i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed .	661.6214418303745
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	5.976483229059379
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i should be looked at .	57.93221246280509
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	38.53229976140506
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .	190.5846740275872
not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people's remarks .	16.791115024323645
elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	9.172932657300752
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	5825623.649707806
yet it is hard she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	1229.692785827702
i will leave him to himself .	2.8813961995734463
in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	5945.600084421335
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	28.121082719796338
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	149.54127573325647
as soon as ever mr. bingley comes , my dear said mrs. bennet , you will wait on him of course .	121.45503911604472
no , no .	1.3090888485365941
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .	752.3499811283921
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again .	35.71113292529892
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield .	435.2978942165995
'tis an etiquette i despise said he .	3.028241503794978
if he wants our society , let him seek it .	7.758352062584398
he knows where we live .	2.210503658982249
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again .	105.02873517688758
well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	81.73770370405374
but , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined .	40.65052210989453
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon .	7.90114698433156
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .	42.784674217281
consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley in consequence of it , before they did .	16936.272744377155
as the day of his arrival drew near ,	6.372725332994147
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister .	47.36109195226589
it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	430.3493775318258
my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says .	401.46975190154126
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over !	19.87369560034455
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth ; but it is wholly out of my power .	187.39412941078734
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much .	475.38855506627726
mr. bingley arrived .	1.2281297316914397
mrs. bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	5555.83665867563
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .	88.15997666163256
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	1675.513868098745
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	5.985187332740017
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked , -- she saw mr. darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	59003.998149507264
there is a gentleman with him , mamma said kitty ; who can it be ?	37.214760177500175
some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know .	68.47052075440158
la !	1
replied kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	45.246163687915825
mr. what's his name .	1.7047614802706794
that tall , proud man .	2.0832067446260676
good gracious !	1
mr. darcy !	1
-- and so it does i vow .	3.792020970843109
well , any friend of mr. bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him .	1401.5995202382185
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .	5.885168892020587
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	6636.392210589647
both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	1.9291271939875871
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr. darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	227248.14691230914
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs. gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	11334.321293997878
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .	695058508.0260168
her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .	19854.35113514093
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	157710.43275767736
but she would not be secure .	2.417157674187899
let me first see how he behaves said she ; it will then be early enough for expectation .	87.33142816413984
she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	9578.041954746397
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected .	25.00675099312816
on the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	6050.656186399329
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	1510.2762302774343
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .	4.623726057125783
he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley .	1781.1739350489893
but , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	79.73197638081945
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	8.398010665314336
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	157.72059041521229
he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	13223.952486271744
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	8438.847298650207
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	581.0068141022681
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire .	615.0536720023042
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	29.99345152683422
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	524233.6404143354
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	69.56042563171255
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	12.072817766751259
could i expect it to be otherwise !	3.5890181348942374
said she .	1
yet why did he come ?	2.8343550578782426
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	405.8703913234276
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	15.804228585584521
it is a long time , mr. bingley , since you went away said mrs. bennet .	33.62814344791811
he readily agreed to it .	2.258139160872349
i began to be afraid you would never come back again .	17.495611892676667
people did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .	327.28026476965056
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	23.71871252734763
miss lucas is married and settled .	2.501026332075784
and one of my own daughters .	3.2447328041343146
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	105.27348672181762
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .	282.7291581917218
it was only said , 'lately , george wickham , esq .	7.796004503304036
to miss lydia bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	1306.7957665391061
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	260.06824339738716
did you see it ?	1.9850027234971772
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	11.006450155607034
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	2.929089848035586
how mr. darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	10.548814498556823
it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married continued her mother , but at the same time , mr. bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	55329.206868850124
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long .	2422.4872762344776
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ---- shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	1163.2679788618213
thank heaven !	1
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves .	24.18638525217298
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	626.1692707651454
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	11612.784547231862
a few weeks , he believed .	2.760505734177681
when you have killed all your own birds , mr. bingley said her mother , i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr. bennet's manor .	8975.932457123965
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .	191.8579798466658
elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	10.03320500465525
were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	2436.7880371961664
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	387.39067491851097
the first wish of my heart said she to herself , is never more to be in company with either of them .	216.18741245607902
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	31.783160456594594
let me never see either one or the other again !	10.211454731864016
yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	11849.195210464677
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	1418.672826619408
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	589.8815863927965
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	410.12656513000604
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	56.09827391901199
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .	1983.108912455138
you are quite a visit in my debt , mr. bingley she added , for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	22535.23574312137
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .	656.7519213208836
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	151.53550378946926
they then went away .	1.7914436731560868
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	44553175.976464055
chapter xii.	1
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	3607.250664581229
mr. darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	3.2274727766293054
why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent said she , did he come at all ?	181.0812678053512
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	11.65366378487201
he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?	632.656527145541
if he fears me , why come hither ?	4.386696408363467
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	8.379354337883886
teazing , teazing , man !	1.9637524213562554
i will think no more about him .	3.7491846214486158
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth .	10969.17274724184
now said she , that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .	26.490943982030803
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	51.32899064215709
i am glad he dines here on tuesday .	5.203123610991541
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance .	130.15279929404988
yes , very indifferent indeed said elizabeth , laughingly .	5.029030408503444
oh , jane , take care .	2.596691471749281
my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now .	50.885740344928664
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .	197.93946080391643
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs. bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	99538.84990713648
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	4436.7843159851955
when they repaired to the dining-room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	10700.971093331325
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	46.712738020359964
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided .	332.5005133612174
he placed himself by her .	2.336580823302994
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	9.501877254323025
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	21272.46552442326
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	123676.34031166525
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	61.18645415536831
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .	107.6901101661438
mr. darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	27.376460545584592
he was on one side of her mother .	7.724792455385562
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	113.17638345628649
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	8179.925209145915
her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	763775.082214024
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	155223.52376525293
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	2522.033834305159
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	211.41187800026992
if he does not come to me , then said she , i shall give him up for ever .	107.16647996931948
the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !	188.53324284496588
the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	41272.15759549962
and on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper ,	288.20585964168873
the men shan't come and part us , i am determined .	9.783671749224444
we want none of them ; do we ?	4.640976133215378
darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	8.893739952802408
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	7904.288549547781
a man who has once been refused !	3.4980834169578077
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	24.51690508674689
is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	273.3218515025257
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !	4.229920395063616
she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying ,	93.64959440444991
is your sister at pemberley still ?	3.502912404048616
yes , she will remain there till christmas .	4.318335857331408
and quite alone ?	1.336319428799394
have all her friends left her ?	3.4123671340385995
mrs. annesley is with her .	2.1098825088255118
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks .	15.040795965350263
she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	337.11158356149167
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .	3549.331160441679
when the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	8892217.123779869
she now lost every expectation of pleasure .	3.7515963530411955
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	28685.26648918336
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	3363.15261417272
well girls said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , what say you to the day ?	98.41764093911782
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .	14.554176980117521
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .	14.77455443024707
the venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	59.03907218461612
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week ; and even mr. darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .	12131.516047962647
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .	17.55109538675364
mrs. long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .	24.44877107407849
and what do you think she said besides ?	5.025845869002588
'ah !	1
mrs. bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last .'	13.751909448352405
she did indeed .	1.4429425327457246
i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously .	4643.538088945578
mrs. bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	248301682.6191524
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth .	21.671493900168436
the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	16.131990808403767
i hope we may often meet again .	4.311913240757282
elizabeth smiled .	1
lizzy , you must not do so .	4.52692870338827
you must not suspect me .	1.9949157651924798
it mortifies me .	1.2181868216341487
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	630.1993548869829
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	206.9374647493303
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man .	214.7656177771893
you are very cruel said her sister , you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment .	277.5620872770191
how hard it is in some cases to be believed !	8.68864055284786
and how impossible in others !	1.891530782101041
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ?	41.29833358296598
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer .	13.006654761618655
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	47.54321164399134
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .	31.3997796934544
chapter xiii.	1
a few days after this visit , mr. bingley called again , and alone .	20.162191037362405
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time .	147.35916522232708
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	28.24875051737613
mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	213.52976031720877
next time you call said she , i hope we shall be more lucky .	18.738225400960445
he should be particularly happy at any time , &c .	7.193814636464904
&c .	1
; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	86.2824594829496
can you come to-morrow ?	1.6497299908986505
yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	61.02981296986079
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	76.78714836748537
in ran mrs. bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out ,	194.35822756097122
my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .	5.393615851143421
he is come -- mr. bingley is come .	6.071422267109513
-- he is , indeed .	2.511261336641648
make haste , make haste .	2.4581098690738794
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .	71.71212326221155
never mind miss lizzy's hair .	1.7602962315472965
we will be down as soon as we can said jane ; but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .	1530.6138533214685
oh !	1
hang kitty !	1
what has she to do with it ?	4.65709109145601
come be quick , be quick !	3.2632324161643935
where is your sash my dear ?	2.693506839568973
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	142.6927621191203
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	51.38253015951318
after tea , mr. bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument .	307.7554060109666
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	1470.3903722729212
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , what is the matter mamma ?	318.26599397266904
what do you keep winking at me for ?	4.075808468649274
what am i to do ?	2.4533001685074294
nothing child , nothing .	1.9278505749227361
i did not wink at you .	1.9320944018572337
she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty ,	379.70771525315547
come here , my love , i want to speak to you took her out of the room .	155.76439397110946
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .	510.86279520056445
in a few minutes , mrs. bennet half opened the door and called out ,	25.924272882154835
lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you .	15.510108067193373
elizabeth was forced to go .	1.7386600346896766
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	143.75641761691688
kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	8.617097968230295
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	4338.552882316774
mrs. bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual .	4.513780615192814
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	48.85568899599138
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	82100.44263143546
