244.35899094517936
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	49.655090267472865
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference .	2.4442234622541044
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time .	17.052101874515234
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	4.012517936749361
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr. bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	10.244004704061632
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	1.7188536476263885
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	16.007639255132332
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs. bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	12.165307089502425
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	120.91425750049619
but on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	84.48599643519788
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	357.60997348810054
their situation was awkward enough ; but her's she thought was still worse .	2.4352515324795325
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	1518.3647928120386
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	56.690172198851286
'tis too much !	1.0092880650379634
she added , by far too much .	1.6729581475992827
i do not deserve it .	1.2562945270046004
oh !	1
why is not every body as happy ?	1.2644248710084207
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	3.370518114671327
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .	2.040583539597906
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	10.634149195594485
i must go instantly to my mother she cried .	1.8823179666118104
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	11.824543023324464
he is gone to my father already .	1.6522961129239568
oh !	1
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	5.393660320648036
how shall i bear so much happiness !	1.299700821722015
she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty .	11.764093134896378
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	14.469479688841684
and this said she , is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	2.1610061431517535
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	1.0697660671098326
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !	1.117381309618941
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	22.839276263918553
where is your sister ?	1.130234839159538
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	2.6236506780868427
with my mother up stairs .	1.7476199842946087
she will be down in a moment i dare say .	2.292189826455328
he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	6.5931889101296
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	3.855347301307052
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	4187.786138873748
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	42.352497482509406
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	2.344365755733273
mrs. bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr. bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	162.4005967950522
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said ,	96.14959347986694
jane , i congratulate you .	1.6378093696606373
you will be a very happy woman .	1.426030710549333
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	4.32238238414264
you are a good girl he replied , and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	18.432791211706142
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	3.547345003061753
your tempers are by no means unlike .	1.344853626636805
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .	16.77232923405842
i hope not so .	1.072112349253151
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me .	2.0193294842497704
exceed their income !	1.0036687543550318
my dear mr. bennet cried his wife , what are you talking of ?	6.810990646347065
why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more .	3.8849323947146104
then addressing her daughter , oh !	1.6344548712422629
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !	4.986999127174552
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	2.4224377626553983
i knew how it would be .	2.2891914416616066
i always said it must be so , at last .	3.1547195322095223
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	2.402778250015071
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together .	31.45786750183237
oh !	1
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !	3.08125556583707
wickham , lydia , were all forgotten .	1.9131741099567998
jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	1.3052462122613264
at that moment , she cared for no other .	2.1432450161152086
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	4.432821755115014
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	6.6562697666441775
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	197.87540478522723
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	71.31687881742543
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	67.88791776845315
he has made me so happy said she , one evening , by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	30.175236801079333
i had not believed it possible .	1.439114392641723
i suspected as much replied elizabeth .	1.7252516386710703
but how did he account for it ?	1.985995785499934
it must have been his sister's doing .	1.693542135536503
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	13.095281939926428
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other .	188.30584883819313
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth , that i ever heard you utter .	3.4959619888858224
good girl !	1
it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard .	5.2287636157887
would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	67.50960884787241
he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty .	5.8175926916132665
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	3.6027156694993825
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	195.89167869345022
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !	1.155192119491311
cried jane .	1
oh !	1
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !	2.851546641939528
if i could but see you as happy !	1.1443654196197313
if there were but such another man for you !	1.3284483722975349
if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .	6.011612531297711
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness .	3.328379525180505
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr. collins in time .	28.200701571762377
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret .	5.060982327865258
mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .	13.35322124413161
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	59.639528846314434
chapter xiv.	1
one morning , about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	719.5484471490414
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	24.627487151707136
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	6.172633846516009
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	17.90922351323631
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	37.42576474915144
it was lady catherine de bourgh .	2.13027023397178
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs. bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt .	101.23867509920484
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	92.04944580714007
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	6.530597861104224
mrs. bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	6.8509371258006775
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth ,	3.862444945159963
i hope you are well , miss bennet .	2.6784837509857278
that lady i suppose is your mother .	1.3087239769641383
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	1.7075022973425205
and that i suppose is one of your sisters .	2.9302759907181617
yes , madam said mrs. bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine .	7.129638515724907
she is my youngest girl but one .	1.1313561823921297
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family .	45.27532461259111
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence .	4.2598897680029975
it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's .	18.64418684598886
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west .	3.150544320961829
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added ,	5.2281137789458905
may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and mrs. collins well .	2.911095626523814
yes , very well .	1.4596120747785375
i saw them the night before last .	1.2211545642056332
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	6.89637335766948
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	2.953358569863194
mrs. bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth ,	34.0301881655678
miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	8.770379654922117
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company .	4.585356441547074
go , my dear cried her mother , and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	6.073768597657533
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage .	3.6105449310280777
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	10.451973334756996
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	96.45251547753944
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	10.450010999686679
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	41.09120921008797
how could i ever think her like her nephew ?	1.681584349439597
said she , as she looked in her face .	1.7104250147317548
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner --	5.639325919316094
you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	6.2215904086433
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come .	2.30004173114242
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	1.244251026119467
indeed , you are mistaken , madam .	2.271925524765985
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here .	5.407809119836405
miss bennet replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .	22.292129492985797
but however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .	3.216005285459037
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it .	13.090511382072435
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	2.47384231256064
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr. darcy .	97.84853050984805
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you .	123.62395845881483
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	25.138375761773926
what could your ladyship propose by it ?	1.3896970703758567
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	1.9729946922586858
your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family said elizabeth , coolly , will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence .	27.499854692121893
if !	1
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	2.8224359690915817
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	1.2639762993643975
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?	1.7107254014760376
i never heard that it was .	1.7610829299406543
and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ?	2.5234982895660094
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	1.2473606229499143
you may ask questions , which i shall not choose to answer .	4.357488412340693
this is not to be borne .	1.6030054523563924
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied .	1.575410164495276
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?	4.7269850593683715
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible .	1.8177630550534172
it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	10.897470201726792
but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	9.36285172091471
you may have drawn him in .	1.176582675904786
if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it .	2.917535669262794
miss bennet , do you know who i am ?	1.943895468743985
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .	1.7015605954215878
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns .	5.759855329864486
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit .	7.661222287148381
let me be rightly understood .	1.2811972705108137
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .	4.171896836050607
no , never .	1.0377180160507369
mr. darcy is engaged to my daughter .	1.6633078462515556
now what have you to say ?	1.4985478621703325
only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .	12.439321063677236
lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied ,	2.990393495410565
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	1.7442215411616808
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	2.760561018166956
it was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .	3.719522664560055
while in their cradles , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	383.440534341951
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	2.2644365885341795
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?	1.7462831696128795
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	2.6086012571088144
have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?	2.620027243054817
yes , and i had heard it before .	2.3187578598923313
but what is that to me ?	1.1740821490822908
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .	33.28110189634893
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	3.0936521959920236
its completion depended on others .	1.7660621848517555
if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	4.496945400220698
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ?	1.9643064989479275
because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	5.976310215994462
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	24.96390779976575
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	4.643391895291922
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us .	3.9921001625126635
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth .	1.553210634485516
but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	42.072829607697535
obstinate , headstrong girl !	1.0909269563959836
i am ashamed of you !	1.4343828384018023
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	2.1554475397149426
is nothing due to me on that score ?	1.51442285889923
let us sit down .	1.5404072098257793
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it .	14.773711517638308
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	1.8331107990162987
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .	2.685675765413383
that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me .	3.355378385781341
i will not be interrupted .	1.455409591694432
hear me in silence .	1.3282648218374389
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	2.3559021265318307
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	27.04470481229895
their fortune on both sides is splendid .	1.3597640085996956
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?	12.303638190224508
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .	3.1513337902135365
is this to be endured !	1.4201945295407492
but it must not , shall not be .	2.1765657680979005
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up .	23.59541486859554
in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	4.43820436088504
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman's daughter ; so far we are equal .	2.3616780253979446
true .	1
you are a gentleman's daughter .	1.2978165453921184
but who was your mother ?	1.0685421841639935
who are your uncles and aunts ?	1.0736544348069268
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .	1.6021645863648413
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth , if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you .	13.073034767884177
tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?	1.8672960827967144
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation ,	29.71136114360955
i am not .	1.0545016075712805
lady catherine seemed pleased .	1.120821766098774
and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?	3.0045741919493354
i will make no promise of the kind .	1.7585218329251424
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .	1.4633867857405858
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	1.9678533880855251
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .	1.6902735505525723
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require .	2.041003533522197
and i certainly never shall give it .	1.5419357958055762
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	2.083352198583059
your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?	4.1734523827571275
supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	10.592414514476133
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	20.93358488618694
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	4.58743221056599
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	8.935788855151257
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject .	4.366662975476069
not so hasty , if you please .	2.6291214017608264
i have by no means done .	1.579968847432647
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .	2.2132612164791547
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	2.8699543438156976
i know it all ; that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	10.022018093832807
and is such a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	1.72024684004879
is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	5.376774659031778
heaven and earth !	1.0181367167957587
-- of what are you thinking ?	1.4247458710009624
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ?	1.4353777721727776
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered .	1.5132957612005744
you have insulted me , in every possible method .	1.6078125231087417
i must beg to return to the house .	3.3960232703967526
and she rose as she spoke .	1.3280267797194734
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back .	2.308741798968035
her ladyship was highly incensed .	1.0955325834362324
you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	3.5693207631730934
unfeeling , selfish girl !	1.0907038005782892
do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?	4.06893390466791
lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say .	1.811228705368055
you know my sentiments .	1.07231925119759
you are then resolved to have him ?	1.545499497052917
i have said no such thing .	1.4505054220992204
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me .	33.4964387453098
it is well .	1.093711825523062
you refuse , then , to oblige me .	1.9217786536159742
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	2.88264966349564
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world .	40.56455249161231
neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude replied elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	4.805750949616616
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy .	4.412112506632196
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .	300.5698496329833
and this is your real opinion !	1.099264580494013
this is your final resolve !	1.0103068619220255
very well .	1
i shall now know how to act .	1.4094296530049701
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	3.1115504614764005
i came to try you .	1.1490760996545741
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point .	4.189394418515814
in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added ,	20.227400716235323
i take no leave of you , miss bennet .	2.4459929825214273
i send no compliments to your mother .	1.9808038291178363
you deserve no such attention .	1.4825917387976113
i am most seriously displeased .	1.072549969997831
elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	12.442267813500825
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	2.885977227821629
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	11.914651464709825
she did not choose it said her daughter , she would go .	3.0950168390093102
she is a very fine-looking woman !	1.4470365391106297
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	1.0767229693617406
for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .	3.3641813601762465
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	10.344595649892797
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ?	3.3036642000747447
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	2.5492736279656536
chapter xv.	1
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	56.147444797718485
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .	12.509900593478243
it was a rational scheme to be sure !	1.6902336530259296
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	141.5025204720879
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	4.139722089760051
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	99.34138544238323
in revolving lady catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	24.639671176193055
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	126.80874116700689
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	843.603162850286
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	7.969848446666495
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	33.71830643918694
in that case he would return no more .	1.8321080646388699
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .	4.140900507488649
if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days she added , i shall know how to understand it .	29.231005593409417
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	1.9876781369370815
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all .	17.78594469974884
the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	241.32903396891243
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	47.3593982665311
lizzy said he , i was going to look for you ; come into my room .	3.90782766856742
she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	37.78364276978861
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .	8.397057337264494
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	4.229070495579367
he then said ,	1.378857992365888
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	3.1236607054889123
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	3.224643402901458
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .	5.983918186940368
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest .	1.7627385383639804
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued ,	318.02950749031305
you look conscious .	1.0722692322199947
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	13.820389157001394
this letter is from mr. collins .	1.5109864804551394
from mr. collins !	1.036417706220407
and what can he have to say ?	2.8356886454743413
something very much to the purpose of course .	2.5081227716690306
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping lucases .	11.408288395837355
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	4.634936275532551
what relates to yourself , is as follows .	1.5060883815468127
having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	44.678816388756054
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land .	136.99717798331733
can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ?	2.0288419893189
this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , -- splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	5.2824404163675585
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .	110.59750851863741
have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	1.624323172333954
but now it comes out .	1.2207444453467586
my motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	1.5253634283171154
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye .	15.931839389083224
mr. darcy you see , is the man !	1.3981762196778258
now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you .	2.6848194928943574
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	10.650409855402783
mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !	5.105632435717904
it is admirable !	1.0101172200147495
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	2.51994193772566
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	7.349851662826214
are you not diverted ?	1.0091538797577813
oh !	1
yes .	1
pray read on .	1.4414392965459368
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	522.4741889196379
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .	41.969340506137165
mr. collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	24.52410982649957
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	26.255284468740562
it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .	7.669251174536035
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	4.36691662173128
that is his notion of christian forgiveness !	1.437331191775082
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	4.5317472379162025
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	3.9846403136240105
you are not going to be missish i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	6.8060636975353725
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?	3.7981822893531807
oh !	1
cried elizabeth , i am excessively diverted .	1.6440249204368704
but it is so strange !	1.4050239926598782
yes -- that is what makes it amusing .	1.8046303949581073
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	14.684837626681228
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins's correspondence for any consideration .	3.1160890112668205
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	8.13914119874661
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?	1.8529008146177899
did she call to refuse her consent ?	1.0820822212991432
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	12.779602760086322
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	5.078442554765685
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	2.396139253120649
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much .	304.02062677586576
chapter xvi.	1
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit .	15.449744298878828
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .	76.84423655199879
it was agreed to .	1.3847902720103902
mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	9.813251526493714
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	2.6529361873454906
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .	10.806244992878515
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .	18.11386929296573
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	32.7305905215985
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said ,	6.9748336609050146
mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your's .	30.950022437765302
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	2.1918195100143767
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .	9.901215800133775
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express .	9.130138366223628
i am sorry , exceedingly sorry replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	32.7216198581738
i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted .	3.2050839877624786
you must not blame my aunt .	1.1981674506700672
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .	15.798151731699736
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them .	80.61861649636928
if you will thank me he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	3.0858945616203513
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .	8.247164792904913
but your family owe me nothing .	1.1589102538772866
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you .	4.166544250477179
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	2.2520075621737283
after a short pause , her companion added , you are too generous to trifle with me .	7.737659256097013
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .	4.3464284315
my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever .	3.661710318684551
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	389.34107028733047
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	39.794328933687254
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	765.9251473062988
they walked on , without knowing in what direction .	1.8405998232906307
there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	12.451600234598777
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .	16674.73038771762
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	2.6586234973843337
it taught me to hope said he , as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	4.280843880035912
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly .	22.205984345609266
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .	7.62993001832635
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations .	2.7529100940080182
what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?	3.3947799154553615
for , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	5.78846807252983
it was unpardonable .	1.0722692322199947
i cannot think of it without abhorrence .	1.7525167766302112
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth .	3.5271684770856204
the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility .	13.821172364939313
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	2.2034799186119067
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	37.71716478118799
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .'	12.104251890816844
those were your words .	1.2436716259897571
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; -- though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice .	16.239371049953714
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	3.2395621412409574
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way .	7.873001033591161
i can easily believe it .	1.672288248125859
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .	4.753893868800306
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me .	15.609360157804021
oh !	1
do not repeat what i then said .	1.3515114176852947
these recollections will not do at all .	2.2834846371043294
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it .	6.925097279082962
darcy mentioned his letter .	1.3574091735638505
did it said he , did it soon make you think better of me ?	2.8384957970231057
did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	1.8034023336780713
she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	3.9139846870640302
i knew said he , that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	7.07492693274491
i hope you have destroyed the letter .	1.3197272831110143
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .	10.459222002228001
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me .	1.4353620989865608
the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies .	108.89420130850628
when i wrote that letter replied darcy , i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	38.878468251339385
the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	3.4251557324731396
the adieu is charity itself .	1.3493396872722785
but think no more of the letter .	2.937364696961368
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	53.48633383007987
you must learn some of my philosophy .	1.9853501049286064
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure .	1.5476646475779707
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	2.256267711205881
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	16.77612058938301
but with me it is not so .	1.7661896885990367
painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .	4.140341422446888
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	3.499891201599202
as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper .	4.5392546370505285
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	2.433480183793358
unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ,) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	3110.1642554085483
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !	3.217728629247864
what do i not owe you !	1.0463192758144044
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	1.7547833743098469
by you , i was properly humbled .	1.7753214814696634
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .	3.2281109575448426
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased .	3.112283112362094
had you then persuaded yourself that i should ?	1.396686502844113
indeed i had .	1.0205668110023463
what will you think of my vanity ?	2.036149076961389
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses .	1.7838715792650772
my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you .	4.308240038711872
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	2.114688882681975
how you must have hated me after that evening ?	1.293422732395242
hate you !	1
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction .	3.0063631863003373
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley .	3.2848543686438036
you blamed me for coming ?	1.122256567256973
no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise .	1.5358895404153987
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .	3.0139834915733865
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due .	19.71011045338231
my object then replied darcy , was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	183.46302330705595
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you .	5.784493783825072
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	460.7321055367984
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	9.256263857757382
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	76.36199454142837
what could become of mr. bingley and jane !	2.9239707927681455
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .	1.5446934981326108
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	5.061622500104364
i must ask whether you were surprised ?	1.1710986697773296
said elizabeth .	1
not at all .	1.334967623386972
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen .	6.680753598133121
that is to say , you had given your permission .	1.6823512293453797
i guessed as much .	1.191440449008553
and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	6.287433613212383
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .	28.163436047652688
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	8.246929856323879
his surprise was great .	1.4273915229612752
he had never had the slightest suspicion .	1.437615447430946
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together .	132.23908268615807
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	4.140254685664972
did you speak from your own observation said she , when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?	9.759560008567354
from the former .	1.3746508504715114
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection .	8.633101859118916
and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him .	4.89001928561875
it did .	1
bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	1.072412772201873
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	8.727768527426225
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	4.486374837539145
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	15.23629770024448
he was angry .	1.1141570289258225
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	5.1622112852254665
he has heartily forgiven me now .	1.4863119069248367
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .	8.029300269153214
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	5.784853352134234
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	39.52143230051748
in the hall they parted .	1.0858050537121904
chapter xvii.	1
my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?	2.1834524002771993
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	37.90819468746595
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	8.27673296540651
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	6.820410691850551
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	1.7352654959204767
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	2.5284494116130265
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	131.63738710838962
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	104.13849110461852
at night she opened her heart to jane .	1.1786090563166458
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	2.6757542954446354
you are joking , lizzy .	1.5000316971333951
this cannot be !	1.4082163931880354
-- engaged to mr. darcy !	1.7418205978103523
no , no , you shall not deceive me .	2.3356021275539325
i know it to be impossible .	2.094043072749511
this is a wretched beginning indeed !	1.180980874795996
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .	28.863699668007875
yet , indeed , i am in earnest .	2.2746986987645603
i speak nothing but the truth .	1.7268426415617317
he still loves me , and we are engaged .	2.220002844199806
jane looked at her doubtingly .	1.5490141182491879
oh , lizzy !	1.1450519539118582
it cannot be .	1.0179097474701486
i know how much you dislike him .	1.676715258202678
you know nothing of the matter .	2.750869013738407
that is all to be forgot .	1.2053683727541797
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .	3.4441555445891208
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	2.785420797525131
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself .	1.4663927158458925
miss bennet still looked all amazement .	1.1755674435873553
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	2.8154615563335628
good heaven !	1
can it be really so !	1.029621067332915
yet now i must believe you cried jane .	1.3001590564786898
my dear , dear lizzy , i would -- i do congratulate you -- but are you certain ?	6.366155710112055
forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	4.58926859102871
there can be no doubt of that .	2.3375606805865594
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	7.757513390202949
but are you pleased , jane ?	1.2698080140192396
shall you like to have such a brother ?	2.028954132428578
very , very much .	1.3031509890453468
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .	1.428458237484193
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	3.975325902864393
and do you really love him quite well enough ?	1.571562813005072
oh , lizzy !	1.1450519539118582
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	1.6998187524053254
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?	2.6235550085342747
oh , yes !	1.3053693132800441
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do , when i tell you all .	8.231543734528145
what do you mean ?	2.0638484375351998
why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley .	3.5401988291325592
i am afraid you will be angry .	3.2449311236875946
my dearest sister , now be be serious .	1.2958952895094842
i want to talk very seriously .	1.0652018874077398
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .	3.414731417922742
will you tell me how long you have loved him ?	2.529072155314957
it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .	2.202275873213244
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley .	1.7816174899947752
another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	12.390303938889002
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish .	1.9441833341838934
now i am quite happy said she , for you will be as happy as myself .	5.98668846876414
i always had a value for him .	1.8598827864112466
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .	28.541342093360036
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	2.756700876192386
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !	1.952017966751142
i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you .	4.740894292069682
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	1.5460138186941559
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	16.978745477792895
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia's marriage .	3.874280967810688
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	2.8461648309035157
good gracious !	1
cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !	11.326322125968899
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	3.2532779753655774
i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	7.5424333289724315
what shall we do with him ?	1.1552367700808388
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley's way .	9.574246540847552
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	6.85451012567949
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , mr. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day ?	285.6985014477233
i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty said mrs. bennet , to walk to oakham mount this morning .	21.65250701878772
it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view .	3.575679106089407
it may do very well for the others replied mr. bingley ; but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .	20.393519269837558
wont it , kitty ?	1.0036226796343843
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	2.9269331589561904
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .	6.368107084401148
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying ,	5.615365374799735
i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	11.042983061663621
but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	124.9662565669611
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience .	1.8477821582979137
during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	10.737483581553171
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	1.7724139750088892
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	11.62338370184025
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	787.2658627760989
in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	24.217919718659722
she did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	5790.7221382892785
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , go to your father , he wants you in the library .	191.82351670111285
she was gone directly .	1.3185223474258079
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	3.7659321157305534
lizzy said he , what are you doing ?	2.1212944409467855
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	2.6882005837725518
have not you always hated him ?	1.0630639615395776
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	4.040120876775014
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .	85.1349854776379
or in other words , you are determined to have him .	3.955206037903956
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .	6.240669524453769
but will they make you happy ?	1.0672666906481445
have you any other objection said elizabeth , than your belief of my indifference ?	3.397970573392036
none at all .	1.3727324759318584
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him .	15.479793072139218
i do , i do like him she replied , with tears in her eyes , i love him .	9.144684770345403
indeed he has no improper pride .	1.3012193738722464
he is perfectly amiable .	1.2688288938263173
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms .	13.020514011734317
lizzy said her father , i have given him my consent .	3.145491447952189
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	14.948198844290015
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him .	4.201150108744522
but let me advise you to think better of it .	2.7735733616387677
i know your disposition , lizzy .	1.6604768128910667
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .	5.768325256068994
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	2.09819577495448
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	1.179179079297653
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .	4.108764816050933
you know not what you are about .	1.9613504167134557
elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	1549.7628610529496
well , my dear said he , when she ceased speaking , i have no more to say .	18.31085484956233
if this be the case , he deserves you .	2.3402233636711314
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy .	4.971454938533419
to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .	4.162670750332226
he heard her with astonishment .	1.5136557107933748
this is an evening of wonders , indeed !	1.3485714454950746
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	5.606873381799283
so much the better .	1.4889221140597033
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .	1.505558409547554
had it been your uncle's doing , i must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	7.202354794662426
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter .	17.753028042608516
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr. collins's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go -- saying , as she quitted the room , if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure .	318.4372333882006
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	20.796378757729222
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	26.255502722352517
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	6.993628119902357
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs. bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	5.069561677762335
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	64.78169683012716
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	13.457643365618928
good gracious !	1
lord bless me !	1.0605121186375182
only think !	1
dear me !	1
mr. darcy !	1
who would have thought it !	1.5848153903722237
and is it really true ?	1.111191012526972
oh !	1
my sweetest lizzy !	1.1260033981407138
how rich and how great you will be !	1.6131574961785515
what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	1.6760224201269445
jane's is nothing to it -- nothing at all .	2.4565678057896827
i am so pleased -- so happy .	1.485037023601142
such a charming man !	1.226389459815592
-- so handsome !	1.0658044448461237
so tall !	1
-- oh , my dear lizzy !	1.7898787196719563
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	1.5430306186225506
i hope he will overlook it .	1.6853943867663033
dear , dear lizzy .	1.214953832475296
a house in town !	1.3994545024008989
every thing that is charming !	1.1098224778808554
three daughters married !	1.0724006494947627
ten thousand a year !	1.1124448734745844
oh , lord !	1.131938641577127
what will become of me .	1.9165911529325452
i shall go distracted .	1.4063947683848657
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	18.7787596666292
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	3.5227578167142393
my dearest child she cried , i can think of nothing else !	3.5150345292597684
ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	2.1001741411776225
'tis as good as a lord !	1.810932902512496
and a special licence .	1.1228245076032097
you must and shall be married by a special licence .	1.5562936186876661
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to-morrow .	6.257712075172199
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	181.26088009027504
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	90.24236450072037
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	38.73444324952367
i admire all my three sons-in-law highly said he .	1.516782686551087
wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane's .	5.945580180825976
chapter xviii.	1
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	10.685082105026545
how could you begin ?	1.117899200962764
said she .	1
i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ?	6.998682822574399
i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	11.947154880870627
it is too long ago .	1.4894272421248345
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun .	2.3447986085775168
my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	38.66335765248012
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ?	1.6550834118570614
for the liveliness of your mind , i did .	1.6872260056597679
you may as well call it impertinence at once .	2.5397453265441947
it was very little less .	1.172918894487179
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	7.759095577963696
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .	4.5956583506573
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike them .	3.4592578855494422
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	20.448349198802013
there -- i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	12.44005307500292
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love .	5.756886670780769
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ?	3.9197115498121886
dearest jane !	1
who could have done less for her ?	1.2503630721395738
but make a virtue of it by all means .	2.3710040348206896
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	1191.9950200958
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	3.856796375515421
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?	4.373227435019877
because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement .	2.2492389512562125
but i was embarrassed .	1.3196394028307066
and so was i.	1.0001297003201952
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner .	2.826031165918552
a man who had felt less , might .	1.4542959866311007
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !	9.93889397711255
but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	7.9457405063731095
i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you !	4.514709677067185
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .	1.9403507658131223
too much i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	15.851989778467676
this will never do .	1.1241211759292953
you need not distress yourself .	1.2605956025304954
the moral will be perfectly fair .	1.6234025308103575
lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	2.431863213631193
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	2.483566248092263
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	2.7588779704521422
my aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing .	4.200166787162244
lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	11.045725763165995
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ?	1.8464262230410193
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?	1.3595846838351753
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?	1.0695020120102743
my real purpose was to see you and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .	5.301782785144383
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made .	28.738958404485725
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ?	4.621386314458614
i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth .	1.7842015743934294
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	18.650604170419868
and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	24.0114646899975
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected .	5.60415761152991
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been over-rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows	359.3716485685707
i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write .	30.26337888303712
you supposed more than really existed .	1.3883755992664502
but now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	29.279034114498923
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	12.703687027781731
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes .	4.649673788799649
how could i be so silly as to wish it !	1.48478712709316
your idea of the ponies is delightful .	1.3283597798573943
we will go round the park every day .	2.825726917748157
i am the happiest creature in the world .	2.3378767993471143
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	2.380733806169818
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh .	2.0282445628744243
mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	6.016026619504052
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas .	2.1319384424476917
your's , &c .	1.0024385476315292
mr. darcy's letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in reply to his last .	27.40519014020945
dear sir ,	1
i must trouble you once more for congratulations .	1.45714089047647
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy .	4.178066111837369
console lady catherine as well as you can .	2.1335413683441677
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew .	5.3638587630001
he has more to give .	1.2908021666335596
your's sincerely , &c .	1.0162404242490295
miss bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	9.027232914991334
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	12.730614089936692
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	14.235639126045035
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .	2.701742995005565
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	12.405458024804453
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .	18.174276600063497
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .	1.7627049267134067
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	23.334303528987636
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	88.84133720058563
he bore it however with admirable calmness .	1.4452140033263028
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st .	14.17929837681033
james's , with very decent composure .	1.3875933923288504
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .	8.090061471457346
mrs. philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .	324.23528319733987
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	8.85350236879186
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .	146272.64059399645
chapter xix.	1
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	3.2567992051532375
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley and talked of mrs. darcy may be guessed .	2.2638198776289604
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	9995.363194680845
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	6.616550475767767
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	4.5654043029602525
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth .	2.74046644221247
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .	6.212109946624559
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	56.3545225719959
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	4.427125564820047
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	6.079452143639104
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	19.16578923699118
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	46.76281870987711
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	15.776732356239116
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	87.38786957515322
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	5.837838208674715
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	62.87041711449328
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	9.853076824685074
the letter was to this effect	1.6663047943457436
my dear lizzy ,	1.1742544361360403
i wish you joy .	1.3035967569326514
if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy .	12.273608440145551
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us .	40.28570214112311
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	8.696799410122583
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr. darcy about it , if you had rather not .	23.646118571453364
yours , &c .	1.0048770515948573
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	7.378123854978079
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	18.52341402691902
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	410.6822391239074
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	7.72737814193115
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	8.196299505040846
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her's lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	23.61932978257807
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	4.376819196040411
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .	50.587649170595355
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .	39.09981833726652
pemberley was now georgiana's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see .	5.864703092209998
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	4.18148935559819
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	70.85344627325331
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	2.879845135685879
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	2.2363328113129515
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	40.44920251870818
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	264.88556737583707
but at length , by elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	24802.75594473483
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	3.627680076581883
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	55.94796762203844
