9.337585319351666
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .	6.425914537155144
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference .	1.7633373996035637
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr. darcy returned within the stated time .	2.91323579003398
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence .	2.0573348645326193
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr. bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	3.167721975791682
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	1.2388726700846153
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .	4.2552071212200415
bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mrs. bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .	5.636418212769922
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes .	15.546930292517859
but on returning to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .	10.11431465269036
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .	23.030134074642692
their situation was awkward enough ; but her's she thought was still worse .	1.3591323477165915
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .	91.62991809218488
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	11.619946738996868
'tis too much !	1.0305903624140034
she added , by far too much .	1.2401260085262664
i do not deserve it .	1.1642392736535538
oh !	1
why is not every body as happy ?	1.1184699655303878
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .	2.4314106782890397
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane .	2.230990444832465
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .	8.151814131260723
i must go instantly to my mother she cried .	1.388209026542584
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .	3.5091379152698385
he is gone to my father already .	1.3046946723199635
oh !	1
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !	2.408836785640638
how shall i bear so much happiness !	1.0830007544899436
she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty .	3.2626631982473273
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .	4.585307851241962
and this said she , is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !	1.686100734078221
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !	1.0834846486533927
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end !	1.1969139420172223
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .	4.49636457179616
where is your sister ?	1.0323294846180209
said he hastily , as he opened the door .	2.1708667795765755
with my mother up stairs .	1.190188403889265
she will be down in a moment i dare say .	1.4308584825703863
he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .	4.616703157184582
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	2.3836012101163866
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super-excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .	142.12266269223582
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .	5.780759127588473
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .	2.3357354182220664
mrs. bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when mr. bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .	12.821923336390324
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said ,	31.868387014755534
jane , i congratulate you .	2.03455790535066
you will be a very happy woman .	1.3041556504534084
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .	2.350461454213544
you are a good girl he replied , and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .	4.350284833953117
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .	2.612104383519018
your tempers are by no means unlike .	1.183025844231457
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .	4.659278008967334
i hope not so .	1.2218536094018773
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me .	1.8084422604445876
exceed their income !	1.0298781694718042
my dear mr. bennet cried his wife , what are you talking of ?	2.537869150481056
why , he has four or five thousand a-year , and very likely more .	2.2636299243142
then addressing her daughter , oh !	1.2557278191847172
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !	3.30947668640253
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .	1.871511213530667
i knew how it would be .	2.7341578620381433
i always said it must be so , at last .	2.0718107821532947
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !	2.3951778525947325
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together .	8.205014455533547
oh !	1
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen !	1.6856732875593834
wickham , lydia , were all forgotten .	1.481623585778959
jane was beyond competition her favourite child .	1.1787973086577286
at that moment , she cared for no other .	1.6469311257610355
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .	2.121220007689818
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	2.6631233904743077
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .	12.808190317987199
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .	6.6367710640510245
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	15.13815932711473
he has made me so happy said she , one evening , by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !	6.347478405018092
i had not believed it possible .	1.2114193009631582
i suspected as much replied elizabeth .	1.1954002498337015
but how did he account for it ?	1.1558932457087714
it must have been his sister's doing .	1.6719496116719672
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .	2.6427942658882575
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other .	14.70916573952284
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth , that i ever heard you utter .	1.826824365916057
good girl !	1
it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard .	2.0217782399700517
would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again !	10.189362532675776
he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty .	5.377480561262719
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	2.104584659306334
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	43.338344162825784
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed !	1.1416276268862697
cried jane .	1
oh !	1
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !	1.8853880458052568
if i could but see you as happy !	1.1929100699747137
if there were but such another man for you !	1.1801176643847717
if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .	2.1901791746354515
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness .	1.8683503623379334
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr. collins in time .	6.342571284304508
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret .	2.109130488140823
mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .	5.37809024151233
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	6.318881960512207
chapter xiv.	1
one morning , about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .	34.12141019786066
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .	5.32584285679714
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	3.066993754782666
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .	5.751338184308748
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	11.533090924787032
it was lady catherine de bourgh .	1.3412797021397282
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mrs. bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt .	6.860781615075575
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .	22.71555376535064
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .	3.550926360637871
mrs. bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .	3.8437292216808796
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth ,	1.795654408715198
i hope you are well , miss bennet .	1.3771599229161637
that lady i suppose is your mother .	1.2500670852799534
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .	1.25005123894369
and that i suppose is one of your sisters .	2.094794608976721
yes , madam said mrs. bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine .	2.23038567934
she is my youngest girl but one .	1.2216700376190803
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family .	10.056737442233603
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence .	1.7507243851467582
it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's .	7.859734239982803
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west .	2.136456389667485
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added ,	1.659566230223274
may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and mrs. collins well .	2.5622608983405084
yes , very well .	1.1453483379328013
i saw them the night before last .	1.3140437725034806
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .	2.8354798274461133
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .	1.8605614294898936
mrs. bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to elizabeth ,	11.140716740158027
miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .	2.46032352817442
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company .	2.216227929207735
go , my dear cried her mother , and shew her ladyship about the different walks .	1.7840275027214503
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage .	1.7078808740855593
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .	2.781099734654931
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .	8.571211115269735
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it .	4.102763869348737
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .	3.7931379251737534
how could i ever think her like her nephew ?	1.7071794736453596
said she , as she looked in her face .	1.5660830677664923
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner --	3.2278962807409677
you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .	3.3676723133438897
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come .	1.7920100293919154
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .	1.1274957234240597
indeed , you are mistaken , madam .	1.6488886282728645
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here .	2.735499454477567
miss bennet replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .	12.003887248719586
but however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .	1.8678863255823552
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it .	4.545030631422507
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	1.5703902964804897
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr. darcy .	19.124884857375466
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you .	8.486186802688776
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .	3.6600722452093533
what could your ladyship propose by it ?	1.1037537206062968
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted .	1.11145464487425
your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family said elizabeth , coolly , will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence .	8.392055515335826
if !	1
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	1.3674700480941058
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	1.0441274630123012
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ?	1.229753074574386
i never heard that it was .	1.2875604798138718
and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ?	1.9224395462899946
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .	1.7540912696814117
you may ask questions , which i shall not choose to answer .	1.7886433231113141
this is not to be borne .	1.6277800157121092
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied .	1.3749426167093641
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ?	3.615396660949695
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible .	1.3682111129192127
it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .	4.260379248936405
but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .	3.104903176015778
you may have drawn him in .	1.2822269463098217
if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it .	2.110444759579416
miss bennet , do you know who i am ?	1.1403213484769081
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .	1.366605885522102
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns .	3.2410525875029994
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit .	2.1148169346406287
let me be rightly understood .	1.1261641525303618
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .	2.132717840553761
no , never .	1.190482950963059
mr. darcy is engaged to my daughter .	1.4191288915509368
now what have you to say ?	1.2045645588621772
only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .	2.6247069645539467
lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied ,	2.3868428683129097
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .	1.4673515794793526
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other .	1.8969028609990317
it was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .	2.121064034821295
while in their cradles , we planned the union and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	23.43057515539866
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?	1.5307980834177135
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?	1.4575076099377116
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?	1.4647124092622912
have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ?	1.60492915428396
yes , and i had heard it before .	1.7083906370700987
but what is that to me ?	1.2431559903638054
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .	4.309438195517595
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .	2.2209645371395794
its completion depended on others .	1.1693053781083544
if mr. darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?	2.3368030541744234
and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ?	1.3873931513272333
because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	2.317396471917278
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .	4.722696339400566
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .	4.641582066689291
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us .	1.8229320826373556
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth .	1.1832147878585695
but the wife of mr. darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine .	11.120505577266618
obstinate , headstrong girl !	1.0281844764690455
i am ashamed of you !	1.174851203428122
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	1.352395849556804
is nothing due to me on that score ?	1.2827341915392734
let us sit down .	1.1823314575201942
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it .	5.508158973203046
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims .	1.5019951374577205
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment .	1.9279757454712043
that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me .	1.6219864082809694
i will not be interrupted .	1.6753754338792635
hear me in silence .	1.1785241080087243
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .	1.5654310039702872
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .	6.180770199034475
their fortune on both sides is splendid .	1.160094358471778
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?	2.860198934322693
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .	1.9397003767428354
is this to be endured !	1.0607926128276794
but it must not , shall not be .	2.0593914388777077
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up .	4.347479188920715
in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .	1.8910791662673674
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman's daughter ; so far we are equal .	1.524018129005074
true .	1
you are a gentleman's daughter .	1.1302709373967377
but who was your mother ?	1.0662899893808668
who are your uncles and aunts ?	1.0531291035241896
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .	1.278077541068299
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth , if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you .	3.491055905358268
tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ?	1.6605992651087653
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation ,	4.581685024708285
i am not .	1.1108315496064751
lady catherine seemed pleased .	1.194669070308737
and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ?	1.6169030272771985
i will make no promise of the kind .	1.4253970958248061
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .	1.1875186265078759
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman .	1.2689326528562392
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede .	1.2169427828691533
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require .	1.7409992521247128
and i certainly never shall give it .	1.2924500028510115
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .	1.2986197898179406
your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished-for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?	2.21261693324293
supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?	3.4243877067904624
allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged .	5.275717100338959
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .	1.922671203188881
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .	2.624755936763743
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject .	2.611170076853531
not so hasty , if you please .	1.4971945628160102
i have by no means done .	1.1481317088305023
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .	1.6539966209735144
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .	1.574693309426149
i know it all ; that the young man's marrying her , was a patched-up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .	4.653658782798732
and is such a girl to be my nephew's sister ?	1.3004512044923142
is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?	3.5483134096005693
heaven and earth !	1.0004558165197035
-- of what are you thinking ?	1.4818890205626638
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ?	1.1664501731686572
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered .	1.3430756461428799
you have insulted me , in every possible method .	1.4312538213224648
i must beg to return to the house .	2.48491241808123
and she rose as she spoke .	1.1796774302796667
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back .	1.544289668544876
her ladyship was highly incensed .	1.194879377440892
you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	2.092121518941717
unfeeling , selfish girl !	1.0281006690740027
do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ?	2.770835677003559
lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say .	1.4164889761379722
you know my sentiments .	1.1245408056854411
you are then resolved to have him ?	1.2062512927830422
i have said no such thing .	1.4027860926478852
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me .	6.899142248294856
it is well .	1.1553216436821976
you refuse , then , to oblige me .	1.5807468658796076
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	2.896080862039692
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world .	6.6836570066870715
neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude replied elizabeth , have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	2.8477546415196278
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy .	1.7662459160182393
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn .	20.63054220984341
and this is your real opinion !	1.0626503647257344
this is your final resolve !	1.0263062192732983
very well .	1
i shall now know how to act .	1.3958850389122528
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	2.4200824408296158
i came to try you .	1.1779024665550875
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point .	2.597627248058027
in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added ,	4.515928355755486
i take no leave of you , miss bennet .	1.4549083710618393
i send no compliments to your mother .	1.3756722220314808
you deserve no such attention .	1.2162413654172448
i am most seriously displeased .	1.1260959093211942
elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .	5.808689272299991
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .	1.3043245285590097
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself .	3.678618042511743
she did not choose it said her daughter , she would go .	1.8143627681220114
she is a very fine-looking woman !	1.478977787163803
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !	1.0711082249327317
for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .	2.48890797451201
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	3.8541201210225293
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ?	1.8205205825378095
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .	2.923513545532389
chapter xv.	1
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .	6.831980649551369
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr. darcy .	3.552132926161612
it was a rational scheme to be sure !	1.201747869336279
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .	29.485377130088665
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .	1.9116440723625243
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .	20.304825731630842
in revolving lady catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	7.008504747333647
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .	10.66951222064028
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .	66.96965178385958
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning .	3.2673187534216153
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .	13.688960460881715
in that case he would return no more .	1.2566306619965524
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way .	2.5255918047106065
if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days she added , i shall know how to understand it .	5.8292880985308235
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	1.5910874952999692
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all .	2.99720576796989
the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs. bennet's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .	22.725981013374017
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .	9.88625347276668
lizzy said he , i was going to look for you ; come into my room .	2.1780510350775137
she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	5.541546940770995
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .	1.958814339429838
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .	2.0278935457205516
he then said ,	1.231488182298342
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	1.4046735121802223
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	2.0671591055411715
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .	4.628343438963909
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest .	1.6352794541396083
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued ,	19.936197922631774
you look conscious .	1.1236052022548935
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .	4.704399127602194
this letter is from mr. collins .	1.2227974559402859
from mr. collins !	1.0210068422084413
and what can he have to say ?	2.1934587321439403
something very much to the purpose of course .	1.6478573917001227
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good-natured , gossiping lucases .	5.25306410673657
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .	1.98405678644974
what relates to yourself , is as follows .	1.6285854916401152
having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority .	6.659408748796675
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land .	12.169578694231648
can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ?	1.5654344902545936
this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , -- splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	3.1269827326009736
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .	16.47977606721604
have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?	1.6171270123540566
but now it comes out .	1.1368123643747474
my motive for cautioning you , is as follows .	1.5321928183000637
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye .	4.23275100703899
mr. darcy you see , is the man !	1.5000895513134127
now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you .	2.315305238653302
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?	4.810261613465628
mr. darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !	2.1235974095236423
it is admirable !	1.0258155321543887
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .	1.3878258593845747
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .	3.0851344861834304
are you not diverted ?	1.0266980341206022
oh !	1
yes .	1
pray read on .	1.1716991237296936
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .	35.35156538712354
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .	11.162274586234014
mr. collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .	2.769995965663919
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .	11.202132591405705
it was an encouragement of vice ; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .	3.3448727698744003
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .	2.7366973179680647
that is his notion of christian forgiveness !	1.0920575783532356
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch .	1.855173924246202
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .	2.160289539627663
you are not going to be missish i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .	2.9328392091379407
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ?	3.181239027847803
oh !	1
cried elizabeth , i am excessively diverted .	1.5059113386076688
but it is so strange !	1.0573357436686248
yes -- that is what makes it amusing .	1.222934021913565
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !	3.182840887582244
much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr. collins's correspondence for any consideration .	2.212311391025908
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .	3.061853161296736
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?	1.335989494686079
did she call to refuse her consent ?	1.222375046696912
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .	4.018691290373849
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .	2.2305492037675396
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	2.2456439780086503
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr. darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much .	22.89299645548423
chapter xvi.	1
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit .	6.386410255349572
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before mrs. bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .	11.122515531817534
it was agreed to .	1.2851070117592471
mrs. bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .	4.526472826929904
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .	2.3737532105135526
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .	4.933910078450839
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .	3.1673137935189026
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .	7.3731442810548256
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said ,	3.857240894047027
mr. darcy , i am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your's .	5.213724386515909
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister .	1.4033591457667105
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .	2.8768135144545406
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express .	4.919940107366179
i am sorry , exceedingly sorry replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .	9.973101382846222
i did not think mrs. gardiner was so little to be trusted .	2.4631188453845976
you must not blame my aunt .	1.2140932723011877
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .	10.798185389906262
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them .	29.67964242779954
if you will thank me he replied , let it be for yourself alone .	1.7948614123423705
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .	6.102309865298401
but your family owe me nothing .	1.1535676760912532
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you .	2.607171530651763
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .	1.464385192043138
after a short pause , her companion added , you are too generous to trifle with me .	3.968807692670942
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .	1.4204424883458808
my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever .	1.5060328710015194
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .	37.83319474360402
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	4.637659682316843
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .	92.34219061564536
they walked on , without knowing in what direction .	1.4311152565569238
there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .	3.899478546640215
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .	368.74766554672544
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .	1.376307921803444
it taught me to hope said he , as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .	2.585357277584435
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly .	8.413293251851378
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .	2.7088073046039334
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations .	2.2077197241599342
what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?	1.6152881099116798
for , though your accusations were ill-founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .	2.2260794119228504
it was unpardonable .	1.1236052022548935
i cannot think of it without abhorrence .	1.273609638160852
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth .	1.5339581717137083
the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility .	4.272856121139976
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .	1.336843080735619
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .	9.193966472097268
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .'	6.924386430444872
those were your words .	1.1278132376050454
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; -- though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice .	6.237013380590558
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	1.4139125928780756
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way .	2.780190321004458
i can easily believe it .	1.7695100120732286
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .	2.6671703281055708
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me .	7.406406089570612
oh !	1
do not repeat what i then said .	1.2636123798218148
these recollections will not do at all .	1.2743299517052784
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it .	3.4986290734597203
darcy mentioned his letter .	1.168795454949989
did it said he , did it soon make you think better of me ?	1.6119659913789293
did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ?	1.4618617613690832
she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .	2.176014900964479
i knew said he , that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .	3.5312196358864667
i hope you have destroyed the letter .	1.2439929099635272
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .	3.960721721040558
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me .	1.238240273606666
the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies .	10.377876391401148
when i wrote that letter replied darcy , i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit .	4.295269200083915
the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .	2.0332925049965813
the adieu is charity itself .	1.1241041727030783
but think no more of the letter .	1.9307170420526762
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .	11.246822126686327
you must learn some of my philosophy .	1.334343496015317
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure .	1.3546139663150234
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .	1.4291818053743945
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .	4.331082293032986
but with me it is not so .	1.392047479640454
painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .	2.2441823021951386
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .	2.1893582935501303
as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper .	2.0006414941049213
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .	1.555333878532421
unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ,) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .	44.01700013604974
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !	3.2019772001044933
what do i not owe you !	1.0826909503523559
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	1.8691817004003433
by you , i was properly humbled .	1.6005680999645564
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .	1.8094306886792566
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased .	1.775339357246183
had you then persuaded yourself that i should ?	1.122328542470326
indeed i had .	1.1641476787911922
what will you think of my vanity ?	1.510712101812271
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses .	1.7033948957006235
my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you .	2.1522561539872314
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	1.616866193312115
how you must have hated me after that evening ?	1.1366607529331683
hate you !	1
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction .	2.0506393369050935
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley .	1.8330966474870498
you blamed me for coming ?	1.0837743437756526
no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise .	1.2112916349806835
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .	1.4606641059771521
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due .	2.810075916329362
my object then replied darcy , was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	10.236785796442312
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you .	1.9602747273366152
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .	47.338839693112575
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	3.4516044904678695
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .	10.778254741537872
what could become of mr. bingley and jane !	1.677812161666213
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .	1.4160962701128983
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .	1.9873542046940829
i must ask whether you were surprised ?	1.118445550494905
said elizabeth .	1
not at all .	1.3024429520944738
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen .	3.529382359203087
that is to say , you had given your permission .	1.5003255118744796
i guessed as much .	1.1768008851406027
and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .	2.2338256009937454
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .	6.073124907990053
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .	3.9633585285287056
his surprise was great .	1.2034980259684018
he had never had the slightest suspicion .	1.2957181124736328
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together .	32.83664141013401
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .	1.9685568890139853
did you speak from your own observation said she , when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ?	2.5588541586359304
from the former .	1.171721017939537
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection .	2.4250671927396295
and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him .	2.2787116625992105
it did .	1
bingley is most unaffectedly modest .	1.1243830276461897
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .	2.5481003252708225
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .	3.0159259040930615
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him .	5.312288916786553
he was angry .	1.1904954197544049
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .	2.413206843237618
he has heartily forgiven me now .	1.201772180068783
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .	2.0323480755615497
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .	7.02892683287614
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	9.365412306809773
in the hall they parted .	1.1886821337903317
chapter xvii.	1
my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ?	1.5437645757436345
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	18.807539597638975
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .	4.350624912050001
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .	2.719991353416794
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .	1.4809166491299621
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .	1.6223227576139228
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	22.19468454466261
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .	6.772983647790722
at night she opened her heart to jane .	1.4750507870938758
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .	2.0632120829685685
you are joking , lizzy .	1.1549124689554184
this cannot be !	1.4165374209268438
-- engaged to mr. darcy !	1.0591289916967324
no , no , you shall not deceive me .	1.753331772245052
i know it to be impossible .	2.2259806154692052
this is a wretched beginning indeed !	1.0346260331521508
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .	8.991528734322312
yet , indeed , i am in earnest .	1.61481440310139
i speak nothing but the truth .	1.3240283323789255
he still loves me , and we are engaged .	1.5050159833081527
jane looked at her doubtingly .	1.064870081032431
oh , lizzy !	1.0243946887278201
it cannot be .	1.1257708398757005
i know how much you dislike him .	1.245833519147801
you know nothing of the matter .	2.1532909457682323
that is all to be forgot .	1.3489067891804083
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .	1.8090674776504156
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .	1.9816520838077434
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself .	1.3371081521104036
miss bennet still looked all amazement .	1.219589890324633
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .	1.4680898772000204
good heaven !	1
can it be really so !	1.0698738956378073
yet now i must believe you cried jane .	1.2485037369574075
my dear , dear lizzy , i would -- i do congratulate you -- but are you certain ?	2.4131719442477455
forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ?	1.4637096352373484
there can be no doubt of that .	1.9413274098637818
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	3.601206655911286
but are you pleased , jane ?	1.265820305178422
shall you like to have such a brother ?	1.3402348686691574
very , very much .	1.1610096722437115
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight .	1.181318510751356
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .	2.4196596160085595
and do you really love him quite well enough ?	1.3838012613704131
oh , lizzy !	1.0243946887278201
do any thing rather than marry without affection .	1.629784341246751
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ?	2.0040501283125196
oh , yes !	1.3219882805632093
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do , when i tell you all .	3.8191477089042514
what do you mean ?	1.9893873081823226
why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley .	1.885223009079321
i am afraid you will be angry .	2.039887176089279
my dearest sister , now be be serious .	1.860294450673598
i want to talk very seriously .	1.2226745028045762
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .	1.7056096758669397
will you tell me how long you have loved him ?	1.1902407821786134
it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .	1.6188067591056081
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley .	1.4660752777812605
another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .	4.359689905305913
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish .	1.5764649575067575
now i am quite happy said she , for you will be as happy as myself .	1.9466466928895811
i always had a value for him .	1.3235954999232376
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .	9.325756692124973
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .	1.6984342055758566
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !	1.444602780152259
i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you .	2.974149037251135
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .	1.5121977197783387
she had been unwilling to mention bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .	3.4844182010206306
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia's marriage .	1.9262883265538722
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .	1.8169196498780709
good gracious !	1
cried mrs. bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !	4.605685801392889
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?	2.637257950702815
i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .	2.66240008680725
what shall we do with him ?	1.1550678940365664
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley's way .	4.258910478361558
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	4.1641928993144255
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , mr. bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day ?	13.368741666093229
i advise mr. darcy , and lizzy , and kitty said mrs. bennet , to walk to oakham mount this morning .	4.49482670021944
it is a nice long walk , and mr. darcy has never seen the view .	2.482174713560715
it may do very well for the others replied mr. bingley ; but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .	3.6275018293654093
wont it , kitty ?	1.0303576915680288
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	1.2914368595568326
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented .	2.070671863010977
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs. bennet followed her , saying ,	3.5679375832729106
i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .	7.850085770734191
but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	17.834911820834293
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience .	1.2716482628735608
during their walk , it was resolved that mr. bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .	5.510507049476715
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .	1.57161581752483
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .	2.6131389011022015
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .	41.210913819433806
in the evening , soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr. darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .	9.200994279011281
she did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .	86.48974908647537
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , go to your father , he wants you in the library .	29.629939212709928
she was gone directly .	1.1260157254146392
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .	2.6502871709748654
lizzy said he , what are you doing ?	1.286215333846717
are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?	1.6806035876297882
have not you always hated him ?	1.0656001705263747
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	2.1565376105847776
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr. darcy .	9.110216329600659
or in other words , you are determined to have him .	3.1262446336324996
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane .	5.678360077952054
but will they make you happy ?	1.0642155443307024
have you any other objection said elizabeth , than your belief of my indifference ?	1.5127567626987228
none at all .	1.43148962024826
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him .	3.8346844203272674
i do , i do like him she replied , with tears in her eyes , i love him .	7.3515995262167815
indeed he has no improper pride .	1.1543750258750822
he is perfectly amiable .	1.159509596937578
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms .	4.209536325207225
lizzy said her father , i have given him my consent .	2.113753600534211
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .	4.35523578025183
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him .	1.6110582730852472
but let me advise you to think better of it .	2.1030875028658667
i know your disposition , lizzy .	1.3388999621442295
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .	2.282278109044517
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .	1.5312795912680484
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery .	1.2569873934859739
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .	1.9718716985335996
you know not what you are about .	1.2004356811012642
elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match .	66.96049517075012
well , my dear said he , when she ceased speaking , i have no more to say .	11.05812256131952
if this be the case , he deserves you .	2.116047686698447
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy .	2.723648038871899
to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr. darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .	1.946941198108824
he heard her with astonishment .	1.5135585373844298
this is an evening of wonders , indeed !	1.3648408680952138
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !	3.499789695753946
so much the better .	1.5542828691099189
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .	1.385144937400797
had it been your uncle's doing , i must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .	2.002350103510012
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter .	4.965125616917809
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr. collins's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go -- saying , as she quitted the room , if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure .	24.504897516049315
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .	6.16327065771255
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .	4.02656386078003
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .	3.9217959512891416
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mrs. bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .	3.988329204273838
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .	11.183253367668964
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .	4.810924863694282
good gracious !	1
lord bless me !	1.0257099794111957
only think !	1
dear me !	1
mr. darcy !	1
who would have thought it !	1.5603342092143653
and is it really true ?	1.0374319896092303
oh !	1
my sweetest lizzy !	1.025706267148637
how rich and how great you will be !	1.117623491301907
what pin-money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !	1.1418283832594458
jane's is nothing to it -- nothing at all .	1.801515701235791
i am so pleased -- so happy .	1.2528862156373366
such a charming man !	1.0360600133351172
-- so handsome !	1.0298689961108338
so tall !	1
-- oh , my dear lizzy !	1.7344921725666487
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .	1.2795389693696229
i hope he will overlook it .	1.6479007879185266
dear , dear lizzy .	1.124012141667188
a house in town !	1.4449429498736301
every thing that is charming !	1.0658852160221957
three daughters married !	1.027287923150879
ten thousand a year !	1.436070499383688
oh , lord !	1.3399299990975744
what will become of me .	1.316406050762438
i shall go distracted .	1.1237640680180185
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	3.1439260825871944
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .	2.712838611215933
my dearest child she cried , i can think of nothing else !	1.803505083750557
ten thousand a year , and very likely more !	2.3579640988867285
'tis as good as a lord !	1.146680639000134
and a special licence .	1.0005285006010016
you must and shall be married by a special licence .	1.139523452316364
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to-morrow .	2.3756125855226684
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	12.232300143099529
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for mrs. bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .	14.768797375328008
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .	6.197748535050972
i admire all my three sons-in-law highly said he .	1.225052114614513
wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane's .	2.0647800130381797
chapter xviii.	1
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr. darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	3.4092188651370674
how could you begin ?	1.037648526775386
said she .	1
i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ?	3.8555839280682824
i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	4.808094750669155
it is too long ago .	1.2062137500582462
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun .	1.5596001185479782
my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .	3.9106918908451145
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ?	1.3215483789465683
for the liveliness of your mind , i did .	1.4050404056236414
you may as well call it impertinence at once .	1.2769369986611132
it was very little less .	1.1426927451451185
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .	5.1355847532693675
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .	2.0600600303477035
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike them .	1.6199106546504618
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .	7.6640516087708805
there -- i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable .	4.987712524131909
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love .	2.801326856958425
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ?	2.345469571656038
dearest jane !	1
who could have done less for her ?	1.1360757326688682
but make a virtue of it by all means .	1.5847280499412921
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .	49.127259291607245
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?	2.4658151650450737
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ?	2.7760900426639425
because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement .	1.7440572202563833
but i was embarrassed .	1.1241772464112736
and so was i.	1.0003845834192617
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner .	1.7440611368215182
a man who had felt less , might .	1.405968365994671
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !	4.955844822222924
but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	2.2873929782889206
i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you !	1.7248912158799965
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .	1.5582080558152775
too much i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	5.048088395160501
this will never do .	1.2067906784816762
you need not distress yourself .	1.1318092524634478
the moral will be perfectly fair .	1.1427124833770002
lady catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	1.9170704145120605
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .	1.5423271025978367
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .	1.600061519715983
my aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing .	2.0976476894957496
lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .	3.371667686972038
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ?	1.6631371327715718
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ?	1.3619813743470905
or had you intended any more serious consequence ?	1.0806266823092747
my real purpose was to see you and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .	3.714380823509107
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made .	8.517439624801183
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ?	2.1282630570891183
i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth .	1.5423127556492844
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly .	8.340708609012838
and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .	6.578179409855872
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected .	2.04163792940944
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy had been over-rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows	23.46695421886362
i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write .	15.60454756083087
you supposed more than really existed .	1.1503147945640775
but now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .	5.451823414952827
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .	5.798297979813164
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes .	2.944088917286513
how could i be so silly as to wish it !	1.3128099927960202
your idea of the ponies is delightful .	1.3413859340646408
we will go round the park every day .	1.2598743600734799
i am the happiest creature in the world .	1.5379765520517006
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .	1.8351937228899404
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh .	1.6980712920951953
mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .	2.753750984818584
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas .	1.4786493958448252
your's , &c .	1.2318354519587884
mr. darcy's letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins , in reply to his last .	9.038214801670831
dear sir ,	1
i must trouble you once more for congratulations .	1.262344284038448
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr. darcy .	2.233863723477174
console lady catherine as well as you can .	1.2629416412053565
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew .	2.1655329944422523
he has more to give .	1.2830400010361063
your's sincerely , &c .	1.1386920564080825
miss bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	2.9935663720741883
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .	3.81058569505346
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	4.249662428231441
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .	1.8411355354207863
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .	3.3602978505629553
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge .	3.9728226762733345
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .	1.456107829090622
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .	4.295275734198585
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	15.194952518939447
he bore it however with admirable calmness .	1.206199260561534
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st .	3.8176468384043383
james's , with very decent composure .	1.151040294118599
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .	2.6984669546368534
mrs. philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though mrs. philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .	21.05609742438631
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .	2.6948321970173157
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .	370.96095108968274
chapter xix.	1
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .	2.7636961417564896
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs. bingley and talked of mrs. darcy may be guessed .	1.5103845740686794
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well-informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .	363.5835920385029
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	2.2902365366694686
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected .	1.6828223669047733
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth .	1.7208517750951402
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .	2.5531665972033277
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .	13.81107182511891
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .	4.230115853174356
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .	2.603478057953534
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	9.653193868251
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs. wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	8.986405943809258
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .	3.9444550449329383
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .	11.06573927512516
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .	2.301170184006629
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .	10.333988098641164
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .	5.7449701226570715
the letter was to this effect	1.6185991834406346
my dear lizzy ,	1.2277668498445649
i wish you joy .	1.156103371125296
if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy .	3.6232505329239104
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us .	28.15575521649222
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .	4.230192777462772
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to mr. darcy about it , if you had rather not .	6.907395348091869
yours , &c .	1.4283294385099523
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .	3.3747645493234972
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	7.624785916804165
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .	11.064569891085794
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	3.147316943211751
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	4.3931569072987005
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her's lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .	9.153327567338822
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .	2.9305503786569314
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .	10.625180061015865
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .	7.024190255784309
pemberley was now georgiana's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see .	2.21309368248967
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .	1.832735199263145
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .	9.59069491591718
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	2.0715239377693933
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .	1.7329759523199555
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .	6.038796565174567
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .	25.75285718347581
but at length , by elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .	651.6317161284912
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .	2.130879161590992
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .	9.504092960629146
