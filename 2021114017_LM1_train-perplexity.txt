pride & prejudice.	1
chapter i.	1
it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .	774.0423832330513
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .	6512795.588234686
my dear mr. bennet said his lady to him one day , have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ?	444.6005880367387
mr. bennet replied that he had not .	2.9713384727609737
but it is returned she ; for mrs. long has just been here , and she told me all about it .	227.2253665873722
mr. bennet made no answer .	2.5704159155277626
do not you want to know who has taken it ?	10.689493846387588
cried his wife impatiently .	1.7643550007238284
you want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it .	28.98224097494902
this was invitation enough .	2.0294952454874435
why , my dear , you must know , mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week .	189659484964.2152
what is his name ?	2.004335125116124
bingley .	1
is he married or single ?	2.6120526037426495
oh !	1
single , my dear , to be sure !	4.480015744235666
a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .	38.378675667635434
what a fine thing for our girls !	5.6963736032347345
how so ?	1
how can it affect them ?	2.8396691634758096
my dear mr. bennet replied his wife , how can you be so tiresome !	25.482302766588923
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them .	24.743770132117085
is that his design in settling here ?	5.7097325640208725
design !	1
nonsense , how can you talk so !	4.297535480977643
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes .	735.4172604397659
i see no occasion for that .	3.0568811738136015
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr. bingley might like you the best of the party .	407195.62756175693
my dear , you flatter me .	3.323103233018536
i certainly have had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .	134.96495501116297
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty .	250.98799783484694
in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of .	45.27277067734015
but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood .	187.69621079868315
it is more than i engage for , i assure you .	13.371773313047706
but consider your daughters .	2.028724547611126
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .	18.915586089061865
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	1781.8165832206853
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not .	145.08120719478507
you are over scrupulous surely .	2.8685945059694142
i dare say mr. bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy .	5647033.01109681
i desire you will do no such thing .	6.03442290065438
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia .	8426.91868479442
but you are always giving her the preference .	7.55447488813002
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he ; they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters .	17412.211550875436
mr. bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	23.658430402673925
you take delight in vexing me .	4.090878276341536
you have no compassion on my poor nerves .	6.3500043389247125
you mistake me , my dear .	2.730141768628886
i have a high respect for your nerves .	6.864302833231864
they are my old friends .	2.869408760861557
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least .	39.280396611669495
ah !	1
you do not know what i suffer .	3.114784464567006
but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood .	814.3294179264773
it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them .	145.22383840406454
depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all .	72.6218676489552
mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .	58627.421057842905
her mind was less difficult to develope .	5.053501711722249
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .	50.76364031341023
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .	6.693139160271201
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .	193.7962666208114
chapter ii.	1
mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley .	29.984621679178083
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	56684.708012520845
it was then disclosed in the following manner .	7.563768006954088
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with ,	80.87392053445991
i hope mr. bingley will like it lizzy .	6.871799924289951
we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes said her mother resentfully , since we are not to visit .	530.9485753050205
but you forget , mama said elizabeth , that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him .	1076.7692918760342
i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing .	16.219862002610785
she has two nieces of her own .	4.837459792589933
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her .	35.866031814987515
no more have i said mr. bennet ; and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you .	385.0220921028596
mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .	554.6332343730115
don't keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven's sake !	14.046883896023807
have a little compassion on my nerves .	4.446448635055585
you tear them to pieces .	2.9005453797560516
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father ; she times them ill .	80.26172723724628
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully .	15.342195183957802
when is your next ball to be , lizzy ?	9.825354163328175
to-morrow fortnight .	1
aye , so it is cried her mother , and mrs. long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself .	27066.131505182537
then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr. bingley to her .	186.60443659741716
impossible , mr. bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ?	391.48480304228303
i honour your circumspection .	2.0283390375486086
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .	5.756089145689606
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	55.03481641833731
but if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself .	3803861.09949291
the girls stared at their father .	4.069295513675589
mrs. bennet said only , nonsense , nonsense !	7.614226630276228
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ?	7.286574352429298
cried he .	1
do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	283.73296858058535
i cannot quite agree with you there .	5.781072779732912
what say you , mary ?	2.7468156233480574
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts .	176.6071453346621
mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .	21.58227773536234
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued , let us return to mr. bingley .	66.37889537903172
i am sick of mr. bingley cried his wife .	7.608545400141451
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before ?	41.73721521588092
if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him .	86.37525786348722
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now .	227.75672824889233
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .	453628.20463271654
how good it was in you , my dear mr. bennet !	9.790549099085464
but i knew i should persuade you at last .	9.789479140242477
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .	57.49997614693128
well , how pleased i am !	4.017200603763927
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now .	844.902070875063
now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse said mr. bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .	9472.96359075745
what an excellent father you have , girls said she , when the door was shut .	75.36571622182403
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter .	792.9678385837469
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	15995.20236670674
lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball .	667.5790643223061
oh !	1
said lydia stoutly , i am not afraid ; for though i am the youngest , i'm the tallest .	134.62762854369237
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	2441.6678568257125
chapter iii.	1
not all that mrs. bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley .	13379.94802181073
they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas .	509766.196170459
her report was highly favourable .	2.8691761374673286
sir william had been delighted with him .	5.349431978604553
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .	3029.9839429353524
nothing could be more delightful !	2.082149079165805
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of mr. bingley's heart were entertained .	1209.5775552628306
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs. bennet to her husband , and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for .	19193.27554346639
in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .	275.10179432671293
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .	4124.441687067939
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .	7325.6410764453985
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all .	56310.843337630846
mr. bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , &c .	403.08222348628226
mrs. bennet was quite disconcerted .	2.241652477286042
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be .	1008334.7466833083
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .	1784912.0923135714
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin .	545521.8874249089
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; mr. bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .	26836.52308252748
mr. bingley was good looking and gentleman-like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .	175.36808143399924
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .	23.123390375231207
his brother-in-law , mr. hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .	70492227.27602784
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	41453330524967.64
mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .	465072.4653259229
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .	5.2833038505917775
what a contrast between him and his friend !	5.675723662552861
mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .	183463.1761625944
his character was decided .	1.759284599161065
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	460.1537601070824
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .	13375.444451390378
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr. bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .	183006118.11089602
come , darcy said he , i must have you dance .	14.886625643524441
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .	39.192056127221605
you had much better dance .	2.6324309942574504
i certainly shall not .	2.0291823802194746
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner .	73.61125360649753
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .	14.652328023657166
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with .	1990.0902740771126
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley , for a kingdom !	30.213754526216118
upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty .	7847.835144822508
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr. darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet .	279.9979478520036
oh !	1
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !	9.914793006936142
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable .	714.2862494447463
do let me ask my partner to introduce you .	11.003112007521167
which do you mean ?	1.96258765356398
and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .	30207283.47487317
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me .	369.6370380577156
mr. bingley followed his advice .	2.8799302481591584
mr. darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .	70.1365920478272
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .	3908.2237007077742
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .	16.31583150610101
mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party .	27.303351508320695
mr. bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .	44.450317547620244
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .	176.87070270985313
elizabeth felt jane's pleasure .	2.0290803974072307
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .	577365.72473535
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .	931.1315956289458
they found mr. bennet still up .	4.061393887291659
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .	19248.33258135236
he had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .	4548.8619144051645
oh !	1
my dear mr. bennet as she entered the room , we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .	280.0713867816036
i wish you had been there .	3.962021874912973
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .	14.489758288562578
every body said how well she looked ; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .	394.7528705607471
only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .	3294.0959067320937
first of all , he asked miss lucas .	7.198666014413604
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance .	227688.36058215192
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .	216.52281305313787
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger ----	15614.376232292918
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently , he would not have danced half so much !	295.3429242640458
for god's sake , say no more of his partners .	12.078581256520005
oh !	1
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance !	9.846600095637069
oh !	1
my dear continued mrs. bennet , i am quite delighted with him .	12.274052049580188
he is so excessively handsome !	2.83464703384895
and his sisters are charming women .	3.347143409466172
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .	24.501701829386366
i dare say the lace upon mrs. hurst's gown ----	8.6702703091863
here she was interrupted again .	2.870937849714997
mr. bennet protested against any description of finery .	8.212224694540057
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy .	11362.071446645143
but i can assure you she added , that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	35695.64585551543
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !	17.54753035069074
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !	43.784885214820584
not handsome enough to dance with !	3.001478297222881
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .	172.19050154349702
i quite detest the man .	2.8901562482693
chapter iv.	1
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .	15477.13994370817
he is just what a young man ought to be said she , sensible , good humoured , lively ; and i never saw such happy manners !	1486.0291636769944
-- so much ease , with such perfect good breeding !	13.255981041003807
he is also handsome replied elizabeth , which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .	202.60083398690253
his character is thereby complete .	2.868677903105598
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .	54.388432754325116
i did not expect such a compliment .	3.8347312408462306
did not you ?	1.1734389060473813
i did for you .	2.0296891464770415
but that is one great difference between us .	6.69603684228922
compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .	13.22177348473863
what could be more natural than his asking you again ?	13.20529960595267
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .	316.0113086902032
no thanks to his gallantry for that .	5.803672021042515
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him .	78.27233898603764
you have liked many a stupider person .	5.296564770442394
dear lizzy !	1
oh !	1
you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .	47.91070835100245
you never see a fault in any body .	8.205428915741676
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .	13.93188116829892
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life .	31.834076217738225
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think .	142.62954249001507
i know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder .	24.703000626148025
with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	80.8299191725672
affectation of candour is common enough ; -- one meets it every where .	39.31316606302123
but to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone .	37369.587232363236
and so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?	28.38311378242963
their manners are not equal to his .	4.957855410319786
certainly not ; at first .	2.8750732124755523
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	21.272912939582156
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her .	4674.994256851551
elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .	55303648.41234356
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .	20696.02776415486
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .	83033835.39460415
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .	37107.118700069484
mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it .	15381.156427217114
-- mr. bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	830265657.2968123
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .	509887494.5975305
mr. bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house .	716.798139598608
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .	81505.94213503566
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character .	131.92972106907771
-- bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	123311.09204749245
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .	224.47136956226362
in understanding darcy was the superior .	4.109792104267195
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .	13.134295621963997
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .	777.7820983604836
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .	9.37352811536155
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .	87.29176971314007
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	25.699448284363978
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .	21504452.60170009
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .	229364.89348992181
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .	34.683173359015726
mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so -- but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .	38233.936759128905
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .	1079.0803321224294
chapter v.	1
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate .	112.581226218491
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty .	40043.379328207906
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .	8.130086802463737
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .	5788667627.443488
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .	1152.4538147649957
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st .	28.68351380834515
james's had made him courteous .	2.6367862131900033
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet .	329.64876850877425
-- they had several children .	2.869179033014511
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was elizabeth's intimate friend .	266.59632308982816
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate .	36687.812187043535
you began the evening well , charlotte said mrs. bennet with civil self-command to miss lucas .	75.49298899185348
you were mr. bingley's first choice .	4.059311087328941
yes ; -- but he seemed to like his second better .	15.035461375808604
oh !	1
-- you mean jane , i suppose -- because he danced with her twice .	29.841700618007653
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her -- indeed i rather believe he did -- i heard something about it -- but i hardly know what -- something about mr. robinson .	34902.48950648657
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson ; did not i mention it to you ?	298.9930206110404
mr. robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?	13896.466667514966
and his answering immediately to the last question -- oh !	11.9613793065074
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point .	78.57478190753578
upon my word !	1.1216195482415272
-- well , that was very decided indeed -- that does seem as if ---- but however , it may all come to nothing you know .	2823.970319445912
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte .	30.451649663042055
mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ?	49.73909442388308
-- poor eliza !	1.4169593371224838
-- to be only just tolerable .	4.061265022826504
i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .	36667.65463942743
mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips .	347.8264830665044
are you quite sure , ma'am ?	4.078562657595925
-- is not there a little mistake ?	5.243404951351537
said jane .	1
-- i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her .	9.227878480743906
aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; -- but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to .	10070.030842876358
miss bingley told me said jane , that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .	93.7847945489468
with them he is remarkably agreeable .	4.065603220659278
i do not believe a word of it , my dear .	8.66213767521533
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long .	31.921593816601018
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise .	385827.1848230313
i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long said miss lucas , but i wish he had danced with eliza .	334.5408922000652
another time , lizzy said her mother , i would not dance with him if i were you .	94.74711143960597
i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you never to dance with him .	48.76130217427253
his pride said miss lucas , does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	855.6907872471521
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .	3067.097266014226
if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud .	30.54998611349741
that is very true replied elizabeth , and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine .	204.15954314533712
pride observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , is a very common failing i believe .	389.8888390065961
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .	7504915.777082635
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	51.679221963164565
a person may be proud without being vain .	8.141948142896481
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us .	359.5695064495622
if i were as rich as mr. darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , i should not care how proud i was .	2727.8699108157384
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day .	137.3721662149179
then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs. bennet ; and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly .	6400.992996196349
the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	785.378231875448
chapter vi.	1
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield .	13.85732501561755
the visit was returned in due form .	5.0275594678242514
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest .	2929116.4560139794
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .	98348404.33416213
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .	10156270016679.766
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .	6.856578075104127
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte , to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	7085.721090094188
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .	118784.00031354625
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	744.0643908946304
we can all begin freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .	9202.46692004137
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .	176.46215279742216
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on .	713.6689486457744
but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .	39.08769133360638
if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too .	164.75034830409305
remember , eliza , that he does not know jane's disposition as you do .	21.163539314528297
but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out .	397.57322017954675
perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	12.517801371646058
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .	179696.96465391456
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .	116.88865798825348
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses .	164.60650454011122
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth , where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .	397262.32450250187
but these are not jane's feelings ; she is not acting by design .	39.32157467537368
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	319.7604010000594
she has known him only a fortnight .	5.7781775400543305
she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .	5947.92580215064
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character .	12.785701385419122
not as you represent it .	2.8800448394260423
had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal .	119685.19146566943
yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded .	75763.20864040827
well said charlotte , i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to-morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	681107.413666096
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .	9.569488812867029
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before-hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .	9338.665979821919
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life .	171301.99348368426
you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .	24.5925561598527
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself .	72.6652120466445
occupied in observing mr. bingley's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .	6654.772747319002
mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .	15513.82282101824
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .	227159.43915935463
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .	8.123939021455337
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .	18417731.305107813
of this she was perfectly unaware ; -- to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .	22297.068266237715
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	1209.3460668926823
his doing so drew her notice .	4.078907933227547
it was at sir william lucas's , where a large party were assembled .	34.11453785579927
what does mr. darcy mean said she to charlotte , by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ?	209.6762687046296
that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer .	10.396206625596845
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .	238.6653749520713
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him .	758.7296289727809
on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said ,	412293.16156527173
did not you think , mr. darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ?	3646.429134632061
with great energy ; -- but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic .	64.45923833679345
you are severe on us .	2.7174079379009384
it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas .	20.88884132419205
i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows .	52.99437592172579
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend !	17.10073039138616
-- always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body !	47.733829394808104
-- if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers .	156513.9467996758
on miss lucas's persevering , however , she added , very well ; if it must be so , it must .	187.78719476557595
and gravely glancing at mr. darcy , there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with -- 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' -- and i shall keep mine to swell my song .	550400.9686759472
her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .	11.67094634576504
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .	114632863.59680094
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .	188774.55386588245
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .	6371622305.357396
mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began .	1879791.007133732
what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr. darcy !	24.98754898668922
-- there is nothing like dancing after all .	6.531385494396545
-- i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies .	22.943221095570486
certainly , sir ; -- and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world .	899.1308509795012
-- every savage can dance .	2.870686087582698
sir william only smiled .	2.0285022331031946
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; -- and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr. darcy .	16757.54023261147
you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir .	18.86166824880139
yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .	22.185999276605095
do you often dance at st .	4.054274389117808
james's ?	1
never , sir .	1.430204872589493
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ?	22.026601615599475
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it .	82.18851534760849
you have a house in town , i conclude ?	7.931089418572714
mr. darcy bowed .	1.4342431298341614
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas .	52363.44430719909
he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her ,	434453.0140612407
my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ?	10.409512065238658
-- mr. darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner .	143.8263962318277
-- you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you .	162.6228523607303
and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr. darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william ,	92153.17516196042
indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing .	18.693404618912382
-- i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner .	260.3356308416666
mr. darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain .	141.16712052000324
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .	267.1746414245286
you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour .	2154686.8740634066
mr. darcy is all politeness said elizabeth , smiling .	6.861322445075777
he is indeed -- but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ?	5847.9525556675035
elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	5.260472596743414
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley ,	2250.7250915381496
i can guess the subject of your reverie .	6.174842313611648
i should imagine not .	2.032527346931277
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion .	4300.126463301886
i was never more annoyed !	2.6458594009488254
the insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people !	161.09955673551585
-- what would i give to hear your strictures on them !	23.135556408089343
your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you .	9.010134923723793
my mind was more agreeably engaged .	4.06241781635255
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow .	1030.444651330952
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .	1877.4832512279772
mr. darcy replied with great intrepidity ,	4.091288015395658
miss elizabeth bennet .	1.304621198372283
miss elizabeth bennet !	1.2393392421692433
repeated miss bingley .	1.430695212787023
i am all astonishment .	2.028602897133342
how long has she been such a favourite ?	6.824622014107086
-- and pray when am i to wish you joy ?	13.026795500239032
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .	15.696102929065933
a lady's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .	698.7057559233336
i knew you would be wishing me joy .	7.477576542705253
nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .	90.6157391650907
you will have a charming mother-in-law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you .	184.41444309016578
he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .	12510.808782957438
chapter vii.	1
mr. bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .	59356094.510356426
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .	67.7053045556632
she had a sister married to a mr. philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade .	60718.77410782831
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way .	3876955.5525868093
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .	8464354707.345739
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters .	130472.53443642671
their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .	37.93648179476038
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections .	40.1762160786131
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .	158.4566439251892
mr. philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .	182.45062705641323
they could talk of nothing but officers ; and mr. bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .	82778.56255716435
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr. bennet coolly observed ,	61.406242023003514
from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	648.9785850976382
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced .	18.364312459506774
catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london .	351533.80846484646
i am astonished , my dear said mrs. bennet , that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .	310.5697382302235
if i wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however .	248.7715281970357
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it .	43.1812542811113
yes -- but as it happens , they are all of them very clever .	38.00982905747108
this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree .	64.84117819470806
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish .	4190.978252938493
my dear mr. bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother .	112.69815062731426
-- when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .	387.6440801114185
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well -- and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals .	4451308225.623432
mama cried lydia , my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library .	277851.7897780564
mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .	3851.8784471966574
mrs. bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read ,	121.90717470079832
well , jane , who is it from ?	4.2010188917060525
what is it about ?	1.7457973633650183
what does he say ?	1.7491858553368627
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love .	52.6011825699514
it is from miss bingley said jane , and then read it aloud .	17.41567984404683
my dear friend ,	1.43990070768993
if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel .	649065.8447173772
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .	15.597975275543918
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .	16.89814949587153
yours ever ,	1
caroline bingley.	1
with the officers !	1.3025361582827173
cried lydia .	1
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that .	16.506202529840255
dining out said mrs. bennet , that is very unlucky .	8.53398614415477
can i have the carriage ?	2.0510653650123642
said jane .	1
no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night .	1337.0844881035766
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth , if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home .	337.1536768188825
oh !	1
but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley's chaise to go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs .	411.64617638456656
i had much rather go in the coach .	7.7371627219431405
but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure .	57.484922949125654
they are wanted in the farm , mr. bennet , are not they ?	24.83263488685069
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them .	30.272342311707632
but if you have got them to-day said elizabeth , my mother's purpose will be answered .	73.78256887170774
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .	86.32168290644184
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .	890.8857101883992
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard .	58.97430142926741
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .	13.962700483245577
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back .	75.72604518331553
this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed !	10.892445654514598
said mrs. bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .	234.9319097281376
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .	62.804006069550795
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth	65.54322878818655
my dearest lizzy ,	1.4319616466969827
i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .	584.4002451171319
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better .	47.901804468967455
they insist also on my seeing mr. jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me .	150325.4822687414
yours , &c .	1.4283294385099523
well , my dear said mr. bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr. bingley , and under your orders .	3432055.60982762
oh !	1
i am not at all afraid of her dying .	6.731793670607406
people do not die of little trifling colds .	8.202527258761306
she will be taken good care of .	4.758715789068032
as long as she stays there , it is all very well .	20.02035515311795
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage .	19.442643992266763
elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse-woman , walking was her only alternative .	7916.595688244132
she declared her resolution .	2.026279685013357
how can you be so silly cried her mother , as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !	197.18326923873053
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there .	15.157180334899751
i shall be very fit to see jane -- which is all i want .	52.92021723724166
is this a hint to me , lizzy said her father , to send for the horses ?	100.75387528727393
no , indeed .	1.3396534616374303
i do not wish to avoid the walk .	4.32046028196617
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles .	67.0895095991186
i shall be back by dinner .	3.209822899439963
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary , but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required .	81376.74558293654
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia .	30.77994721355373
-- elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	38.28119112439514
if we make haste said lydia , as they walked along , perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes .	953.2514281059541
in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .	11079378779.106512
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise .	1438.9264360688296
-- that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .	355320.684332777
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness .	4149.02726279608
-- mr. darcy said very little , and mr. hurst nothing at all .	22.51354542003198
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone .	7767.441006489533
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	8.23724971234522
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .	13.959563307445713
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .	370.79396502284595
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .	1329137.7571064
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	19097.22570720522
elizabeth silently attended her .	2.039438044342948
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane .	7276.2954213010535
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .	948113.5470128054
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .	110.5823114048248
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .	9479.199934486578
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so .	165.54171143368924
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present .	1621313.8656264194
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .	3945.2656531301022
chapter viii.	1
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner .	300.39631188107
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .	10051.618543453162
jane was by no means better .	2.40075773221697
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .	577394072.1215861
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .	115.93812064887288
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .	28423.57710333243
she had very little notice from any but him .	10.062169676522366
miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for mr. hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .	183794690.14621916
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	1395.6316178194754
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	6517.00105981182
mrs. hurst thought the same , and added ,	7.700295471479982
she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .	78.03650092354425
i shall never forget her appearance this morning .	7.098136045303764
she really looked almost wild .	2.86961710617718
she did indeed , louisa .	2.78936257873742
i could hardly keep my countenance .	3.4310457147594127
very nonsensical to come at all !	3.7004420555647695
why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?	77.70512161302855
her hair so untidy , so blowsy !	5.782779144417474
yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office .	107291.06288372785
your picture may be very exact , louisa said bingley ; but this was all lost upon me .	208.71820862581777
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	77.25071301484705
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice .	5.737792032105269
you observed it , mr. darcy , i am sure said miss bingley ; and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition .	5488.781117358277
certainly not .	1
to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !	6545.9336663509885
what could she mean by it ?	4.03485128942689
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum .	357.8906587630187
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley .	25.23311888576349
i am afraid , mr. darcy observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes .	1128.313584675926
not at all he replied ; they were brightened by the exercise .	20.410660890639438
-- a short pause followed this speech , and mrs. hurst began again .	29.118029401848695
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled .	2192.270024641994
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it .	237.92968873770351
i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton .	78.58187493212085
yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside .	22.12549840551708
that is capital added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	19.7656319473472
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley , it would not make them one jot less agreeable .	295.6902432834276
but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy .	214.627863193306
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .	28788.060222660577
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .	2126.941732968658
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	586055.203609236
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .	13689516.335528573
mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment .	4.896154195509301
do you prefer reading to cards ?	4.053395080088836
said he ; that is rather singular .	5.7746378308920026
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley , despises cards .	7.1468076559520455
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else .	21.47793043591982
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth ; i am not a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things .	941.732393193786
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley ; and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well .	1133.232091904406
elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .	229.13480698275544
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .	43.53020498114678
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into .	34225.98381230037
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .	46.08828524429295
i am astonished said miss bingley , that my father should have left so small a collection of books .	168.4020358691931
-- what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr. darcy !	25.05358259506147
it ought to be good he replied , it has been the work of many generations .	53.16381141519976
and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books .	85.49251019212181
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these .	62.13530872583411
neglect !	1
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .	88.45710579156025
charles , when you build your house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley .	116.52465093551648
i wish it may .	1.8017314850480934
but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model .	557.370508894085
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire .	13.536731740479143
with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it .	70.78115107788057
i am talking of possibilities , charles .	5.901369798264998
upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation .	333.6422358531304
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card-table , and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .	2414511.958675085
is miss darcy much grown since the spring ?	7.063993279697395
said miss bingley ; will she be as tall as i am ?	21.43371114504982
i think she will .	2.027143334237737
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height , or rather taller .	33.180725293737176
how i long to see her again !	3.237863850008705
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much .	12.203862704348445
such a countenance , such manners !	4.086642493161216
and so extremely accomplished for her age !	5.728143799250907
her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite .	5.336779502072935
it is amazing to me said bingley , how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are .	1344.4230112946989
all young ladies accomplished !	2.0040113066815324
my dear charles , what do you mean ?	7.585591820593904
yes , all of them , i think .	5.259707016991701
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .	16.6552516140198
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished .	22560.269120750483
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy , has too much truth .	64.0590745847021
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .	1425.7672272819873
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	79.75323271397335
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished .	649.5319512034894
nor i , i am sure said miss bingley .	6.634703357518708
then observed elizabeth , you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman .	87.96450153405371
yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it .	10.998302594019064
oh !	1
certainly cried his faithful assistant , no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	1811.5232873273196
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved .	544068388.1746919
all this she must possess added darcy , and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading .	3375.69582000559
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .	29.99116915159746
i rather wonder now at your knowing any .	7.504208328716715
are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ?	85.01445139067368
i never saw such a woman .	3.45044805433637
i never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united .	304.8717960779881
mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr. hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	5083149.742403021
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .	71.06982397221665
eliza bennet said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds .	493310.0096322333
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art .	64.26858429731647
undoubtedly replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .	2660.3763004304515
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable .	5.812349521775392
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .	47.54767052543639
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .	213.16711798271453
bingley urged mr. jones's being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .	79532.43324371584
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ; and it was settled that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better .	278370.13636054815
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .	25.469019111384863
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	506195.7702857334
chapter ix.	1
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .	20140401.49070227
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	13157.572289350946
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	43.50586233871288
mrs. bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .	121.36955128975053
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs. bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield .	3986314.8858506638
she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .	14857.574731801342
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .	3499.8938166676176
bingley met them with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected .	109.67558010761462
indeed i have , sir was her answer .	7.349661745049275
she is a great deal too ill to be moved .	10.409559042544528
mr. jones says we must not think of moving her .	11.838760628087213
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness .	10.176531939653115
removed !	1
cried bingley .	1
it must not be thought of .	3.5747539721454844
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal .	19.261316581171773
you may depend upon it , madam said miss bingley , with cold civility , that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us .	2587.7675922112257
mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .	4.36194963692339
i am sure she added , if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with .	275008302.4124256
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .	21.54410422530611
you have a sweet room here , mr. bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	148.7330019234804
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield .	37.37841719689059
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease .	154.37293229885884
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he ; and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes .	4764.460455985375
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here .	15.821373328199044
that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth .	15.885199655481118
you begin to comprehend me , do you ?	8.329904324679193
cried he , turning towards her .	3.2202389623280925
oh !	1
yes -- i understand you perfectly .	4.069093362093673
i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful .	342.8430445871777
that is as it happens .	2.7183166862548482
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours .	740.414769465843
lizzy cried her mother , remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home .	1976.332618680065
i did not know before continued bingley immediately , that you were a studier of character .	72.49783597580864
it must be an amusing study .	2.908020854236741
yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing .	10.637436852965038
they have at least that advantage .	3.5455863898568927
the country said darcy , can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	85.42311656059856
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society .	36.44234263165378
but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever .	223.28916231188103
yes , indeed cried mrs. bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .	55.626106486094194
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town .	137.12884052591815
every body was surprised ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .	167.07677194453055
mrs. bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .	125.59163845269423
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .	582.1544184492923
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr. bingley ?	44.84244574597707
when i am in the country he replied , i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same .	1574.7758427128279
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either .	45.097743922986865
aye -- that is because you have the right disposition .	14.094670565883984
but that gentleman looking at darcy , seemed to think the country was nothing at all .	99.14396114364921
indeed , mama , you are mistaken said elizabeth , blushing for her mother .	30.404997893269027
you quite mistook mr. darcy .	2.8682266561208767
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true .	4677.025581427888
certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .	3730.5166507118597
i know we dine with four and twenty families .	11.617141147921688
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .	33.15642546527795
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile .	149.9047910180006
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away .	4613.289284796999
yes , she called yesterday with her father .	6.468288371615897
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr. bingley -- is not he ?	39.58734463959405
so much the man of fashion !	3.3225664743716083
so genteel and so easy !	2.840105427722661
-- he has always something to say to every body .	10.744146910260861
-- that is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter .	5043.075224579805
did charlotte dine with you ?	2.851419609956509
no , she would go home .	3.116220838323036
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .	11.632888322693994
for my part , mr. bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently .	1010.3629125696876
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you .	323.3778611703871
it is a pity they are not handsome !	5.016798079789925
not that i think charlotte so very plain -- but then she is our particular friend .	88.21632988932441
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley .	10.53911366377183
oh !	1
dear , yes ; -- but you must own she is very plain .	26.014417178628708
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane's beauty .	43.475454548352985
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane -- one does not often see any body better looking .	1579.0055543109186
it is what every body says .	3.230086292395276
i do not trust my own partiality .	4.162728258571935
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .	56873.758503854864
but however he did not .	2.3565317664037027
perhaps he thought her too young .	4.085350864226424
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were .	29.640680515372388
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently .	8.168815254726402
there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way .	60.54986792662273
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love !	46.615163436936996
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy .	41.33893967834608
of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .	16.86730469603176
every thing nourishes what is strong already .	5.756462656275004
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away .	1411.9639203589654
darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .	559.8451166909455
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy .	67346.45786214553
mr. bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .	1563.7251417053185
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs. bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .	357.43302215356897
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .	26.31775590474906
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield .	287396.5984889949
lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	50459.9174380287
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .	69710.18099092081
she was very equal therefore to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	216985.70684949704
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .	30.335137865379103
i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	11163.990379536934
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill .	26.55591853092482
lydia declared herself satisfied .	2.028555684226328
oh !	1
yes -- it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again .	2293.2576835752857
and when you have given your ball she added , i shall insist on their giving one also .	115.41711567537935
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not .	54.94934860181216
mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on fine eyes .	34598867.92715072
chapter x.	1
the day passed much as the day before had done .	10.805967875834522
mrs. hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room .	28432.165717663735
the loo table , however , did not appear .	6.70284623525212
mr. darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	8770.334844118344
mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet , and mrs. hurst was observing their game .	88.67640829860404
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion .	348.74595991717405
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .	13930048.703296153
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter !	21.212053904823193
he made no answer .	1.917588606027016
you write uncommonly fast .	2.0284105468181375
you are mistaken .	1.4300168187694713
i write rather slowly .	2.0283893929557806
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !	50.51852036518366
letters of business too !	2.0052605834066077
how odious i should think them !	3.328199024958976
it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours .	80.62335669534971
pray tell your sister that i long to see her .	10.233755984217174
i have already told her so once , by your desire .	18.897468605356423
i am afraid you do not like your pen .	7.04674014327783
let me mend it for you .	4.092463233870349
i mend pens remarkably well .	2.8705947858006033
thank you -- but i always mend my own .	7.378800294650884
how can you contrive to write so even ?	6.347848945250861
he was silent .	1.3435901272129092
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's .	444338.77768507355
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ?	25.577897433801006
-- at present i have not room to do them justice .	14.870779828988256
oh !	1
it is of no consequence .	2.5082605928970128
i shall see her in january .	3.5744505793266117
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr. darcy ?	34.44299345537583
they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine .	96.75234320216573
it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill .	567.7687821252161
that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline cried her brother -- because he does not write with ease .	481.4185425194869
he studies too much for words of four syllables .	9.801335991667946
-- do not you , darcy ?	3.7126335909889354
my style of writing is very different from yours .	10.582781359821327
oh !	1
cried miss bingley , charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .	20.598673405616537
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest .	21.805572956425408
my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents .	5072.032391516822
your humility , mr. bingley said elizabeth , must disarm reproof .	13.718551211173247
nothing is more deceitful said darcy , than the appearance of humility .	18.1234721555132
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast .	32.575561286919886
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ?	52.777249334599006
the indirect boast ; -- for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	1018333.3471843753
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	4158.99770490604
when you told mrs. bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ?	6636058843.386515
nay cried bingley , this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	778.6580329370041
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment .	931.7221485126968
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies .	261.5365021690801
i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .	239.02217001688527
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month .	768005711.1984799
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth , that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .	162.37843775873722
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself .	26.33964556636333
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley , by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .	1161.7963140288882
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could .	2375100.8004067494
would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ?	703.542352158829
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself .	69.52958949073265
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged .	267.86082273850496
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety .	22982065.265697468
to yield readily -- easily -- to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you .	155.53728658745402
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either .	30.74275414056723
you appear to me , mr. darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	111.51408392882047
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .	2053.508227748217
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley .	66.64032964850702
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .	627.9173768669331
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ?	10604808.009896312
will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ?	379940.4467851026
by all means cried bingley ; let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of .	209133.05703590135
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference .	2552.1850686662237
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do .	124454.46935680241
mr. darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .	246.66112415845768
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .	412.64732032202716
i see your design , bingley said his friend .	11.724324513127053
-- you dislike an argument , and want to silence this .	21.133792001694793
perhaps i do .	1.4288381602011058
arguments are too much like disputes .	3.725127683363597
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me .	12136.775198348434
what you ask said elizabeth , is no sacrifice on my side ; and mr. darcy had much better finish his letter .	251.5823874731624
mr. darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .	17.401582588308106
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	177.97339569140854
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .	40846.46677502333
mrs. hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr. darcy's eyes were fixed on her .	177200.61383123926
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .	30903.45732528832
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .	89199.38533841216
the supposition did not pain her .	4.091321774423876
she liked him too little to care for his approbation .	14.032595076762362
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air ; and soon afterwards mr. darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her --	7242.5677732181275
do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ?	179.524613957618
she smiled , but made no answer .	5.738820454418923
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .	19.096178806844794
oh !	1
said she , i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply .	142.45502119042519
you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .	290009.50902567303
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare .	5200.289082204349
indeed i do not dare .	2.0799811059828555
elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	9649686.574128436
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .	507.6369679360734
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth .	47262.594639189505
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .	3289.034523662595
i hope said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , you will give your mother-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers .	33509755.267848853
-- and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses .	5704.244479189344
have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ?	20.770690006478315
oh !	1
yes .	1
-- do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley .	178.81802045824003
put them next to your great uncle the judge .	11.73596061065776
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines .	43.037078033702876
as for your elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ?	1579.6371070636005
it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye-lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied .	6007.477959863108
at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself .	66.76661427795342
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	359.378705433748
you used us abominably ill answered mrs. hurst , in running away without telling us that you were coming out .	345.96144238335904
then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself .	96.61740366501635
the path just admitted three .	2.869447431626227
mr. darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , --	11.643479772424133
this walk is not wide enough for our party .	11.557311118817712
we had better go into the avenue .	4.243573746958717
but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered ,	54.74667402613981
no , no ; stay where you are .	6.495853986082806
-- you are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage .	20.721656450550505
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	11.590715090416984
good bye .	1
she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .	1071.1322835559513
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .	217.13716219437805
chapter xi.	1
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing-room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	90851448.41625227
their powers of conversation were considerable .	4.064179680440352
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	624.1667852330711
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object .	24.774079454270822
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .	549.5363891624559
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; mr. hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation .	31669.361813317773
he was full of joy and attention .	5.844740950074116
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place , that she might be farther from the door .	421773.63334743946
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .	30.72967271880308
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .	82.06350198903733
when tea was over , mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain .	104.69817280261177
she had obtained private intelligence that mr. darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	1087.8230314612558
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	889.4551213712216
mr. hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .	301.018939158531
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and mrs. hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet .	102775.34280314161
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .	95742.6724480751
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .	302.79662963309704
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !	3602429.036608702
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !	11.446006943583729
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book !	26.75737454429945
-- when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library .	169.77476848214198
no one made any reply .	2.866701130516315
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said ,	247403.5065125605
by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ?	92.27509915491763
-- i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure .	905245.5206756758
if you mean darcy cried her brother , he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins -- but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards .	2794955.5557818757
i should like balls infinitely better she replied , if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .	12244.642571572987
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day .	249.11335485974175
much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball .	362.85170382630474
miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .	75.60719947743137
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; -- but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .	1129.0013410411175
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said ,	251.446057444976
miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .	394.39539915181626
-- i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude .	47.039449823467955
elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .	8.59618309713837
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr. darcy looked up .	119.78592858008629
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .	1456.5378961962062
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .	774293.0952975902
what could he mean ?	2.004335404157418
she was dying to know what could be his meaning -- and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	510.7490436523167
not at all was her answer ; but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it .	21893.593666417935
miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .	1190.4154104528418
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	195.89335390051082
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; -- if the first , i should be completely in your way ; -- and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire .	4122373527.8088937
oh !	1
shocking !	1
cried miss bingley .	1.2713240986136018
i never heard any thing so abominable .	5.178907599139604
how shall we punish him for such a speech ?	8.461143200848374
nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination said elizabeth .	20.995934182292988
we can all plague and punish one another .	7.51090089453728
teaze him -- laugh at him .	4.074574056488515
-- intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done .	53.035606839913456
but upon my honour i do not .	3.686721185881256
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .	32.55830837606898
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !	6.880187736265872
no , no -- i feel he may defy us there .	16.622297833961866
and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .	618.018397162944
mr. darcy may hug himself .	2.6323407948716238
mr. darcy is not to be laughed at !	4.57694804152869
cried elizabeth .	1
that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .	2356.6183865206517
i dearly love a laugh .	2.8834612895571183
miss bingley said he , has given me credit for more than can be .	40.15841452602664
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke .	24367.37463533264
certainly replied elizabeth -- there are such people , but i hope i am not one of them .	113.00491281592899
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good .	14.980381543693436
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can .	418.77482337034957
-- but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without .	29.90956410595163
perhaps that is not possible for any one .	6.303092480279401
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .	566.3781129371608
such as vanity and pride .	2.723359637874329
yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	5.779919722528972
but pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation .	221.07848032469272
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .	5.817047536307699
your examination of mr. darcy is over , i presume said miss bingley ; -- and pray what is the result ?	170.985009196614
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect .	15.621502487930167
he owns it himself without disguise .	4.062798241889011
no -- said darcy , i have made no such pretension .	12.394626847302888
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding .	51.777013842888884
my temper i dare not vouch for .	5.0194249956638695
-- it is i believe too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world .	177.1531329715091
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself .	334.62371606223854
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .	24.504366419909214
my temper would perhaps be called resentful .	5.750981770947599
-- my good opinion once lost is lost for ever .	13.160301948790936
that is a failing indeed !	2.4659524710278724
-- cried elizabeth .	1.4294272264664347
implacable resentment is a shade in a character .	8.242597417663292
but you have chosen your fault well .	5.749486521650615
-- i really cannot laugh at it .	5.774467961890799
you are safe from me .	2.876312775530426
there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome .	6396.762234044782
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body .	16.518094200662592
and yours he replied with a smile , is wilfully to misunderstand them .	37.28232506880703
do let us have a little music -- cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .	329.0705410220888
-- louisa , you will not mind my waking mr. hurst .	15.748835845664566
her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano-forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .	2213.9386117273802
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .	25.562546685159578
chapter xii.	1
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	21553.487144177136
but mrs. bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	28263.58665242217
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	555.2075974611795
mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well .	257155.7040342236
-- against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .	2590958603.445185
the communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred .	96198.09449354878
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .	2693.364604874725
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	1657897.792806054
to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence -- elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough .	45.40196161541256
she attracted him more than he liked -- and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself .	621.4307972089082
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	44714711.91064349
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .	1424726.1811623722
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .	257.87201234890017
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former .	42668954.36276459
-- elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .	16.818062179339538
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .	13.713140236372194
mrs. bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again .	3428.615965058089
-- but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle .	6692.27043377381
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth .	7206.274960079629
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to .	79884.63032102234
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort .	18.997793361190684
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married .	2680882.420475163
chapter xiii.	1
i hope , my dear said mr. bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party .	70084.1174710008
who do you mean , my dear ?	3.4179216031208437
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope my dinners are good enough for her .	5925.50659651777
i do not believe she often sees such at home .	11.618241100982882
the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger .	28.14053744069454
mrs. bennet's eyes sparkled .	1.8162478296026732
-- a gentleman and a stranger !	3.58488967362429
it is mr. bingley i am sure .	4.408919086454892
why jane -- you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing !	55.568248122341174
well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley .	21.418345919827086
-- but -- good lord !	2.8345549462990136
how unlucky !	1
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day .	22.040814477697843
lydia , my love , ring the bell .	6.620528633466746
i must speak to hill , this moment .	7.8000325881428605
it is not mr. bingley said her husband ; it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life .	568.3794975599011
this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .	665.7671671775994
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .	30.677607386700725
about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .	11561.098513843435
it is from my cousin , mr. collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases .	2624.651086306897
oh !	1
my dear cried his wife , i cannot bear to hear that mentioned .	24.344940669807546
pray do not talk of that odious man .	7.608094631757671
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it .	571364.9090802338
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .	26.66606012542252
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .	7044315.16625647
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr. bennet , and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn .	703.724871094415
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself .	345.90874417267247
no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .	1980.4123777568232
i hate such false friends .	2.8694422445087104
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ?	92.11967116736443
why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear .	282.8170961010436
hunsford , near westerham , kent ,	4.146978308408894
15th october .	1
dear sir ,	1
the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .	83046281427.11664
-- there , mrs. bennet .	2.353359657488255
-- my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england .	24110393458785.605
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .	32013332079.822224
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , -- but of this hereafter .	551019.9315858386
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	477898788487.0324
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well-wisher and friend ,	302.58094962403015
william collins.	1
at four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman said mr. bennet , as he folded up the letter .	351.8707033413395
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again .	205339.91204183293
there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him .	15508.713033564873
though it is difficult said jane , to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit .	19296.275780532083
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .	7513.391847951364
he must be an oddity , i think said she .	9.122299025589747
i cannot make him out .	2.878562632035682
-- there is something very pompous in his style .	8.211495054198041
-- and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ?	53.61818267952262
-- we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could .	20.808859293167483
-- can he be a sensible man , sir ?	8.608118745492712
no , my dear ; i think not .	5.18448362078967
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .	16.59925366186595
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .	42.98531957714631
i am impatient to see him .	3.5050537027085507
in point of composition said mary , his letter does not seem defective .	37.58454008115941
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed .	187.0200971793403
to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .	98.27968509916212
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .	46745.554931646846
as for their mother , mr. collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .	30650.301567180326
mr. collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .	95.39124050040103
mr. bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr. collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .	6736.903982392437
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .	25.490535740064086
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .	30.841889987733747
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .	592544903.1365539
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs. bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily ,	2597.38649949463
you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .	4626.764264370867
things are settled so oddly .	2.87442285002575
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate .	9.963784783727437
ah !	1
sir , i do indeed .	1.907283229989311
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .	26.66669932610201
not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world .	429.48195199731407
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed .	66.1159992944513
i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , -- and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	14703.719392669558
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them .	47.5621672888538
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted ----	48.58726883496042
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .	85.58087932171584
they were not the only objects of mr. collins's admiration .	10.87021236191408
the hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs. bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .	522197.3510894359
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .	6820.963550412681
but here he was set right by mrs. bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .	94206.12225822943
he begged pardon for having displeased her .	5.799267831478625
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .	845.1798836006983
chapter xiv.	1
during dinner , mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .	7733052.168261717
lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .	172.09870137206877
mr. bennet could not have chosen better .	3.6550098277303666
mr. collins was eloquent in her praise .	4.134014603757149
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine .	1488203.0734367024
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .	487.56827970967583
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	8649.440188834164
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .	372.4396298640664
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .	1644206.4516934988
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , -- some shelves in the closets up stairs .	410032139.4444225
that is all very proper and civil , i am sure said mrs. bennet , and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman .	450.81452566753416
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .	44.024718688744215
does she live near you , sir ?	4.882549490404044
the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship's residence .	766.0849442365617
i think you said she was a widow , sir ?	12.477935851394374
has she any family ?	2.0048567659660748
she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property .	82.21296937032048
ah !	1
cried mrs. bennet , shaking her head , then she is better off than many girls .	83.88832597127251
and what sort of young lady is she ?	6.1498692512142625
is she handsome ?	1.4170956878979784
she is a most charming young lady indeed .	4.9774573356287455
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .	154844.27591205577
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .	1317224.3217388205
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies .	486.8877971553168
has she been presented ?	1.837799252923241
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court .	16.930239508306776
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament .	30636.94125692905
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .	9193.650645580403
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her .	69393.54308325078
-- these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay .	3071.1540159584856
you judge very properly said mr. bennet , and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	895.211746480032
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ?	533.1932336196204
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .	1145780.6029593612
mr. bennet's expectations were fully answered .	4.064547097513254
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .	1191852.4915499561
by tea-time however the dose had been enough , and mr. bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .	47874.93106986021
mr. collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library ,) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels .	549449.4271748466
-- kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed .	7.540643003558472
-- other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce's sermons .	49.71457402580369
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with ,	3992.570062590181
do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him .	1756.8557498999223
my aunt told me so herself on saturday .	7.514937145116951
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town .	423.4255452444927
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but mr. collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said ,	2935.2699545804953
i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit .	1437.068392851129
it amazes me , i confess ; -- for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .	381.6375252349124
but i will no longer importune my young cousin .	9.105660640963034
then turning to mr. bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .	39.52407293082362
mr. bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	626.488457421386
mrs. bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr. collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr. bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	1690578355.0245726
chapter xv.	1
mr. collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	554818327.0284566
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .	2564420.3180581797
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .	6392014187.983926
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .	13192908.19470039
this was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .	251188.06254680155
his plan did not vary on seeing them .	6.533143824602003
-- miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice .	23816.042198522813
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs. bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on .	16059281275.772163
-- as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not know of any prepossession ; -- her eldest daughter , she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged .	7279874.709955634
mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth -- and it was soon done -- done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire .	1130.0969501306022
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .	89.15952959802601
mrs. bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	64775.4679349225
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and mr. collins was to attend them , at the request of mr. bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither mr. collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr. bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford .	4692158608297.366
such doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly .	4.067076478834941
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr. collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	7819135374229.383
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton .	850.2909917278319
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .	67.65245094001791
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	111537.37305329359
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman-like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .	43552.245542582044
the officer was the very mr. denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .	1209.841758265915
all were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .	315081871.0192725
mr. denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr. wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .	176248.61235303158
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .	244.99474536875542
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .	4407.4924333655445
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street .	42604416.56152932
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .	434.64119889806403
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object .	27.240078965343873
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .	145.12042666920865
mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .	15505801.673850885
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .	22.063026256714988
mr. wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat -- a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return .	370.4525618699932
what could be the meaning of it ?	3.510275805346084
-- it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .	38.93827646578426
in another minute mr. bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	600.9717659164526
mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr. philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs. philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .	7527865.176427523
mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr. jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr. collins by jane's introduction of him .	51971000353563.34
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .	4729987.943537812
mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr. denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ---- shire .	556782991.5231882
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr. wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become stupid , disagreeable fellows .	223495873.3009029
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr. wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening .	323437.91151518654
this was agreed to , and mrs. philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	5707.1114116447525
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .	78.91965407003374
mr. collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .	287.65770416512845
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	618137.5727023741
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs. philips's manners and politeness .	114.84618957353379
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .	3277808.652502849
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .	2892.53917656978
chapter xvi.	1
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all mr. collins's scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing-room , that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .	34038180035.404964
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr. collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .	9.947988286457857e+17
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in mrs. philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	27657775308.098732
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .	825632.7220075302
it was over at last however .	4.068286442935533
the gentlemen did approach ; and when mr. wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .	54039.530347599604
the officers of the ---- shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman-like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .	873789246.8457919
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	117180653726.16072
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr. wickham and the officers , mr. collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .	165073265.8985783
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .	625.0510640375504
i know little of the game , at present said he , but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life ---- mrs. philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .	504022.0259239315
mr. wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia .	768.9699181941036
at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .	28015979.810363512
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy .	2200576.8137581935
she dared not even mention that gentleman .	4.743740479762097
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .	4.072175926148789
mr. wickham began the subject himself .	3.8252775275819557
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there .	5932.743071251213
about a month said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand .	5995.345138213625
yes replied wickham ; -- his estate there is a noble one .	23.732326072491013
a clear ten thousand per annum .	4.048298878245087
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy .	35284.60046472821
elizabeth could not but look surprised .	3.103598312654136
you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .	6295.225022214021
-- are you much acquainted with mr. darcy ?	6.312025880016593
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly , -- i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable .	5120.511395823199
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham , as to his being agreeable or otherwise .	113.47081878571262
i am not qualified to form one .	4.284199304435743
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .	35.93684837213601
it is impossible for me to be impartial .	6.215392782159591
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else .	931.0066284838421
-- here you are in your own family .	7.140143184789655
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield .	404.7086065747842
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire .	5.75580869061935
every body is disgusted with his pride .	5.299336936577896
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one .	25.04362617753064
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham , after a short interruption , that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with him i believe it does not often happen .	51919.46781711569
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen .	10931.198884328824
i should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill-tempered man .	87.78682988974874
wickham only shook his head .	2.898694334709953
i wonder said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , whether he is likely to be in this country much longer .	274.7399884849922
i do not at all know ; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .	189.20821992832563
i hope your plans in favour of the ---- shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood .	164.5317725242903
oh !	1
no -- it is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy .	29.0012723411144
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go .	15.578181488345974
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .	7927782.380898357
his father , miss bennet , the late mr. darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .	1595493.8392015041
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father .	34798.71162727871
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .	1176.4493154735196
mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	577686.1023724404
it was the prospect of constant society , and good society he added , which was my chief inducement to enter the ---- shire .	683.441714241056
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them .	112612.48273360015
society , i own , is necessary to me .	9.963810925238727
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	26.88195918741023
i must have employment and society .	3.3598448798865874
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .	228.20374672480548
the church ought to have been my profession -- i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now .	317087.21887465985
indeed !	1
yes -- the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .	161.47491316263444
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .	13.20093566949753
i cannot do justice to his kindness .	4.999800301664756
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere .	688.706845360359
good heavens !	1
cried elizabeth ; but how could that be ?	5.721074208931016
-- how could his will be disregarded ?	5.2715521472515565
-- why did not you seek legal redress ?	5.780285985986292
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .	376.85736299461223
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr. darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	5670921.716991139
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .	13502386.056555584
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .	967.1377604161769
i can recal nothing worse .	2.8704357231917266
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me .	125.09241214083256
this is quite shocking !	2.003964868107639
-- he deserves to be publicly disgraced .	5.812593867619859
some time or other he will be -- but it shall not be by me .	38.01969934356848
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose him .	36.895044116524794
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .	123.04437754922272
but what said she , after a pause , can have been his motive ?	30.323020790300625
-- what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ?	16.31475543184327
a thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .	497.744841434857
had the late mr. darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life .	25981.214592112563
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me .	1425.8201346960593
i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this -- though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him -- i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this !	35980473.75210395
after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , i do remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .	14636.956657748953
his disposition must be dreadful .	2.635596368673251
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham , i can hardly be just to him .	84.81891755596386
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , to treat in such a manner , the god-son , the friend , the favourite of his father !	13308.941054004996
-- she could have added , a young man too , like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable -- but she contented herself with and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner !	18943902.327887442
we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .	321412.3238499455
my father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr. philips , appears to do so much credit to -- but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr. darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property .	3772330.5601995923
he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .	52.513277282389524
mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself .	77090208.25395694
how strange !	1
cried elizabeth .	1
how abominable !	1
-- i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you !	211.53170893318048
-- if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , -- for dishonesty i must call it .	1984.2486948505448
it is wonderful -- replied wickham , -- for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; -- and pride has often been his best friend .	4597.972923049041
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .	19.51396214466946
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride .	390.02326680601556
can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ?	33.08016906824761
yes .	1
it has often led him to be liberal and generous , -- to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .	16712.095281074708
family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .	393.9896821681045
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive .	4747.461660890455
he has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers .	203021.50524057614
what sort of a girl is miss darcy ?	4.900756415322488
he shook his head .	1.9364541759111014
-- i wish i could call her amiable .	6.438764742246918
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy .	10.9033398099271
but she is too much like her brother , -- very , very proud .	35.87846380909491
-- as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .	2073.900393342234
but she is nothing to me now .	4.267168569109905
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished .	64.42453564722112
since her father's death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education .	628.3245639816455
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying ,	808.4393548789709
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley !	10.082033804412859
how can mr. bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	2860.077744511277
how can they suit each other ?	4.009432889851331
-- do you know mr. bingley ?	3.112067721614783
not at all .	1.3024429520944738
he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	13.15171919055075
he cannot know what mr. darcy is .	3.3416618850892608
probably not ; -- but mr. darcy can please where he chuses .	22.52386180279671
he does not want abilities .	2.2434070770636056
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .	43.16717945898997
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .	1274.1699784858165
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , -- allowing something for fortune and figure .	30556.24074453079
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. philips .	5421.514738127263
-- the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	38.93994148076561
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	34245643.61940869
i know very well , madam said he , that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , -- and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .	362049.03233360476
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters .	4816.267514726156
mr. wickham's attention was caught ; and after observing mr. collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh .	45788.861911547734
lady catherine de bourgh she replied , has very lately given him a living .	29.92729088163964
i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long .	426.1703079279873
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy .	1559.7465944621256
no , indeed , i did not .	2.750674697562294
-- i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections .	8.521456063779537
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday .	14.48192881757283
her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates .	2200.0738368108973
this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley .	33.54311855858027
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self-destined to another .	5441.127700923703
mr. collins said she , speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman .	1666976.4636462766
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham ; i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	88952.32768402112
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class .	109228164.7924723
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickham's attentions .	116441.61509869464
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	563.525219867633
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .	49.4827498535054
elizabeth went away with her head full of him .	11.697330169756539
she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent .	1728035.632461748
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr. collins , in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .	26193006848.427162
chapter xvii.	1
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr. wickham and herself .	54.59530493478325
jane listened with astonishment and concern ; -- she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingley's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham .	2467152.468812722
-- the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .	66562484.69331597
they have both said she , been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .	1117.2053426154096
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .	10.159646558678935
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side .	2391.859746659462
very true , indeed ; -- and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?	7008.577042328636
-- do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody .	61.05251309881294
laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .	72.55669014711391
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy , to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner , -- one , whom his father had promised to provide for .	94762.55845218356
-- it is impossible .	1.4103432151833952
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	438.0300099319874
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?	22.98679407647987
oh !	1
no .	1
i can much more easily believe mr. bingley's being imposed on , than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony .	166043.17227923518
-- if it be not so , let mr. darcy contradict it .	27.67435934852854
besides , there was truth in his looks .	6.208562580288975
it is difficult indeed -- it is distressing .	6.161957948368304
-- one does not know what to think .	5.203210844895884
i beg your pardon ; -- one knows exactly what to think .	18.866281734534763
but jane could think with certainty on only one point , -- that mr. bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .	13387.411220673222
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday .	12753921.09471012
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	27092.335459353024
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .	7152.31128104022
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet's civilities .	28306.269678012835
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .	68.65947279981413
mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .	15363.482947750585
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy's looks and behaviour .	1869246.9779731177
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	54355940.2749232
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	44.838389054046296
while i can have my mornings to myself said she , it is enough .	40.968823797924074
-- i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .	22.75272833947535
society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body .	1821.1242972242296
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance .	1624916064994.087
i am by no means of opinion , i assure you said he , that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , -- a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her .	225488494764805.38
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	3.7462853328114445
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances -- and to have mr. collins instead !	290.8788167095492
her liveliness had been never worse timed .	5.74490543212658
there was no help for it however .	4.416848890204751
mr. wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr. collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	2667.62726273692
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more .	149.79208243336117
-- it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .	306432.8241733318
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .	856214960.6416351
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .	1207.8396789207068
mr. collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .	306.86300358058367
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once .	39390143.773174375
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; -- the very shoe-roses for netherfield were got by proxy .	1421.8435714088184
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .	11467999.549031219
chapter xviii.	1
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	44797.479911648385
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	418.07199243502885
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .	380027.7620310008
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr. denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile ,	104229710309.54471
i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here .	1203.540957423778
this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make .	7549583635.369377
-- attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .	42.105247171440666
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	57320.12543531402
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .	2411410479.52716
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .	166.18105320435808
mr. collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .	164583.6149124421
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	11.645663391302632
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .	876.6978277063831
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .	3449051.0166411814
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .	1831.8149587475045
i dare say you will find him very agreeable .	6.963123323695063
heaven forbid !	1
-- that would be the greatest misfortune of all !	8.41259955428161
-- to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !	29.98916738380837
-- do not wish me such an evil .	6.024860726658171
when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .	2398506.785124371
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .	547608.7697508625
they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .	267110576.72531888
he replied , and was again silent .	3.4717685364704067
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with	29.356003757712983
it is your turn to say something now , mr. darcy .	14.159634755287302
-- i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples .	2701.2233769501436
he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .	72.89899613655248
very well .	1
-- that reply will do for the present .	7.621480240773584
-- perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones .	187.21058767448548
-- but now we may be silent .	5.750316601845175
do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ?	21.391360541527167
sometimes .	1
one must speak a little , you know .	6.986038152807754
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible .	71906.60165026133
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ?	395.327557320125
both replied elizabeth archly ; for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .	281.07259317822985
-- we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb .	293892.4487042295
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure said he .	77.65096009330429
how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say .	23.93048504595703
-- you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly .	6.940628602788163
i must not decide on my own performance .	8.157550018196014
he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton .	10266.808736217388
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance .	18653.22802458075
the effect was immediate .	2.028420251926665
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .	6375.260132114543
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said ,	19.31136366513902
mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends -- whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain .	5935.878296017933
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis , and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life .	5648.322940240917
darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .	17.53186800511752
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .	1508475.5894898635
i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .	12.158452943144825
such very superior dancing is not often seen .	8.151533427911401
it is evident that you belong to the first circles .	14.153319550263758
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley ,) shall take place .	1772869.9834663456
what congratulations will then flow in !	4.036791128157617
i appeal to mr. darcy -- but let me not interrupt you , sir .	38.10077918442317
-- you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me .	1896.9693198285445
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .	656926.8236175316
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said ,	61.13470650619052
sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of .	32.92819251318387
i do not think we were speaking at all .	7.148975806257009
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .	207.64610406491437
-- we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine .	751.185692719854
what think you of books ?	2.446780689747535
said he , smiling .	1.5090302835248153
books -- oh !	1.4157591178090663
no .	1
-- i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings .	63.90601498129119
i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject .	563.2155403543263
-- we may compare our different opinions .	5.740002612060448
no -- i cannot talk of books in a ball-room ; my head is always full of something else .	280.4598482979858
the present always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ?	21.20547937135046
said he , with a look of doubt .	4.41717079850268
yes , always she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , i remember hearing you once say , mr. darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .	10611150.072358085
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created .	17.944529997092392
i am said he , with a firm voice .	7.523265769020349
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ?	11.5238817348637
i hope not .	1.4342391898234843
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .	408.12311379765623
may i ask to what these questions tend ?	7.021809072489509
merely to the illustration of your character said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .	83.9456640788168
i am trying to make it out .	5.345877716794656
and what is your success ?	2.083596392521078
she shook her head .	2.0413384604218776
i do not get on at all .	4.181167925584995
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly .	19.8443559702539
i can readily believe answered he gravely , that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either .	11871409.048442906
but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity .	58.394353675687555
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied .	34.61410442780726
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .	14449569.709795585
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her ,	339.3320574241729
so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !	30.945818675331243
-- your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy's steward .	1462744.0363399445
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .	130570735.25838758
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .	135480507.8867217
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .	780.1802105524279
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better .	3684.886258423187
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily ; for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy's steward , and of that i can assure you , he informed me himself .	1456759.2770620137
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .	21.67336462471008
excuse my interference .	1.434242477331058
-- it was kindly meant .	2.316217199223154
insolent girl !	1
said elizabeth to herself .	2.024840846603351
-- you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .	187.28528688478346
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr. darcy .	109.50499016021105
she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley .	170.10642745911468
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .	17557.082988932118
-- elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .	47790.917544095275
i want to know said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , what you have learnt about mr. wickham .	734.1742885116214
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon .	1146.987627150547
no replied jane , i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you .	56.23490232779614
mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	180121587881.52484
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy's regard .	85.24027580282987
mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself ?	6.230440273243803
no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton .	32.98943168545221
this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy .	14.43710404857539
i am perfectly satisfied .	1.8775479290201307
but what does he say of the living ?	6.357666720263748
he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only .	5503.869863941755
i have not a doubt of mr. bingley's sincerity said elizabeth warmly ; but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	765.7724524797973
mr. bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before .	3327233.4201677972
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .	719.2776576104108
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .	9822.255380695498
on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	26227556.84364559
i have found out said he , by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .	1216.789249816517
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine .	25101.724639513308
how wonderfully these sort of things occur !	5.244726484964089
who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly !	425.14420702846945
-- i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	151991.0875679227
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology .	16.59236915348827
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy ?	9.466065137773896
indeed i am .	1.3396576241981788
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .	20.125749889009025
i believe him to be lady catherine's nephew .	5.764708762182754
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night .	91.30973582416297
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .	9122873666.833374
-- mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus ,	911.7469022576038
my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .	6765262144773.733
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty .	11540.789502464044
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself .	5558210.38877151
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .	12757.938614746381
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh .	334700.79349182587
-- it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .	23.400647663717944
mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	3434.7922083218455
mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .	261133.87201419054
mr. collins then returned to elizabeth .	4.098272891932805
i have no reason , i assure you said he , to be dissatisfied with my reception .	42.36922146780863
mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	6.437274913126631
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily .	40010.4182324648
it was really a very handsome thought .	4.134965352878697
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him .	8.410701554301351
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .	2209462.6933849053
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters .	162541.0235737209
her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	2674.1215034313796
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley .	531030169.2845658
-- it was an animating subject , and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .	315.13345695170335
his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self-gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .	41272518.82933581
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .	1098411596.1665184
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .	493250.5637895122
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	2688.091581266053
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy , who sat opposite to them .	5809529.426836002
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	8.20265430344926
what is mr. darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?	62.2306120212105
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear .	575.8329548812488
for heaven's sake , madam , speak lower .	6.388328138214939
-- what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy ?	27.29487134173727
-- you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing .	23.03345098091898
nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .	10.594893619633307
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .	26.19921097327134
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .	10.761927666232179
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .	174079.36715369983
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .	123.62873749827435
at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	610921.1449923282
elizabeth now began to revive .	2.9005399063132717
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .	140520.30680994721
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , -- but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .	676843.5632890934
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .	1617721625.9939954
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected .	331.7877496393692
-- elizabeth was in agonies .	2.6770603689537955
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley .	212.05239770497246
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	1228.5992826842821
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .	114.483780620335
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud ,	74.90370435027971
that will do extremely well , child .	5.837714863584643
you have delighted us long enough .	4.049050693470698
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit .	11.631474159415603
mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good .	16185.64646896223
-- others of the party were now applied to .	8.165042723201793
if i said mr. collins , were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman .	5139480.5656917505
-- i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .	25610.21736763904
the rector of a parish has much to do .	10.82507512870969
-- in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .	1918.1452507220781
he must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .	304550.8439688791
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .	5574.182831623597
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family .	15640.408290652285
and with a bow to mr. darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room .	1712.6977691062657
-- many stared .	1.4342407807212814
-- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	3809675.534245354
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .	133009372073.45839
that his two sisters and mr. darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .	526691.7592117382
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .	8.42952512960943
she was teazed by mr. collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	40891.27874286409
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .	1586.5903095521371
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .	364012.35642674816
there was no arguing upon such a project .	6.232418617766504
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins's conversation to herself .	1163.7873698337787
she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .	36723.072208181715
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham , and rejoiced in it .	167.283818663087
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	17642158.337092545
mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .	993.7756140056301
they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins , who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .	175082500.17705926
darcy said nothing at all .	2.777012735971202
mr. bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .	15.86166500511458
mr. bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	371.89349802604426
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord , how tired i am !	44196.937733286206
accompanied by a violent yawn .	2.8686444554045916
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	110706774.4133501
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .	61798.5585817168
mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	1298199.085261611
of having another daughter married to mr. collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .	628.1689342367424
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield .	41997.22032244095
chapter xix.	1
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn .	8.851730032041033
mr. collins made his declaration in form .	5.799248765824472
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .	148368695.732016
on finding mrs. bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words ,	809.5308311995105
may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ?	8030.881361887988
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs. bennet instantly answered ,	107.18134221370461
oh dear !	1
-- yes -- certainly .	2.028800978204604
-- i am sure lizzy will be very happy -- i am sure she can have no objection .	101.84343355667684
-- come , kitty , i want you up stairs .	13.24175165438501
and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out ,	54.77899292355057
dear ma'am , do not go .	2.99136800529721
-- i beg you will not go .	4.0892923987896355
-- mr. collins must excuse me .	3.5434730078287746
-- he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .	59.21794557100155
i am going away myself .	2.3203497996441427
no , no , nonsense , lizzy .	4.967025395656557
-- i desire you will stay where you are .	8.723962369258533
-- and upon elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing mr. collins .	12371.59872718752
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction -- and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .	17752239.678803183
mrs. bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr. collins began .	61.1278290407138
believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .	1221.0627046560983
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address .	21133.208820584474
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .	9612.226215042498
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life .	198.18597162766878
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did .	755457.6854687727
the idea of mr. collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued	574659.1358247445
my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .	30470.599050459765
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .	1430676.4614946865
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too !	28.074682656176876
) on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while mrs. jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool , that she said , 'mr. collins , you must marry .	362597.88722881454
a clergyman like you must marry .	3.7695620054748775
-- chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ; and for your own let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .	783905.6936195026
this is my advice .	2.02852454545346
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her .'	228.71819338638096
allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .	54123.093341697044
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .	172477.65641019662
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .	149815.24452650096
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer ,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years .	123952824265.29538
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	309.8433068111479
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	454.3909237709522
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents .	223803.53157997527
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .	317.16098134783647
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married .	4682.766554523906
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	7.012042718769007
you are too hasty , sir she cried .	7.19102789700017
you forget that i have made no answer .	5.453198988736786
let me do it without farther loss of time .	10.061525491160264
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .	15.153876326318539
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them .	453.6449790726147
i am not now to learn replied mr. collins , with a formal wave of the hand , that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .	73249617.8166022
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .	994.3369721139986
upon my word , sir cried elizabeth , your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .	186.74652304492614
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .	160975.965140458
i am perfectly serious in my refusal .	4.674389495501614
-- you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so .	457.00555001553033
-- nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation .	2616.8832444089417
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr. collins very gravely -- but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .	3698.6976371439455
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications .	8749.84288561024
indeed , mr. collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .	20.041014898941665
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say .	164.60166245546574
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .	954.8393921509725
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach .	24786.036953391565
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled .	14.988960179364932
and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr. collins thus addressed her ,	309.91696931935246
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .	675662638400.8142
really , mr. collins cried elizabeth with some warmth , you puzzle me exceedingly .	43.55405186304105
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one .	37922.76457096317
you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .	659.864062904358
my reasons for believing it are briefly these -- it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable .	101478.22699052638
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	48940028.18500482
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .	567.1437319335917
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .	204669.13836534804
i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .	764.1553444796173
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .	19.294122179023564
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .	798.6148003767654
my feelings in every respect forbid it .	4.593297961319002
can i speak plainer ?	2.0040933992368117
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart .	1875.5691649978232
you are uniformly charming !	2.004136235469109
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .	47480.67862191031
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .	5624249647.240142
chapter xx.	1
mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for mrs. bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .	13180324345.259308
mr. collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .	227678342.46408716
this information , however , startled mrs. bennet ; -- she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .	539745.1241417438
but depend upon it , mr. collins she added , that lizzy shall be brought to reason .	77.73814329551354
i will speak to her about it myself directly .	9.872400524340867
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it .	436.0768775407588
pardon me for interrupting you , madam cried mr. collins ; but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .	2201335.282852604
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .	190553.00892762933
sir , you quite misunderstand me said mrs. bennet , alarmed .	16.822856496024396
lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .	11.591358834137587
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .	42.43061278017163
i will go directly to mr. bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure .	280.84935541779885
she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library ,	673.7827275484694
oh !	1
mr. bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .	34.00340480093701
you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her .	18973.490760324363
mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .	15223.95259156106
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he , when she had finished her speech .	57.48508381437117
of what are you talking ?	2.6067727535551652
of mr. collins and lizzy .	1.926892997445563
lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins , and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy .	188.08673621390673
and what am i to do on the occasion ?	8.355469549772105
-- it seems an hopeless business .	4.062396124650919
speak to lizzy about it yourself .	4.076082451551935
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him .	9.62402567758009
let her be called down .	2.6329504986720385
she shall hear my opinion .	2.8675086601373185
mrs. bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .	33.17735027467469
come here , child cried her father as she appeared .	13.830053630116165
i have sent for you on an affair of importance .	16.558996162617838
i understand that mr. collins has made you an offer of marriage .	20.09666966143913
is it true ?	1.4170967687504108
elizabeth replied that it was .	2.2465588590035788
very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ?	16.586283151107324
i have , sir .	1.9312294467582796
very well .	1
we now come to the point .	3.310104382339245
your mother insists upon your accepting it .	5.770191042952823
is not it so , mrs. bennet ?	3.953546480750084
yes , or i will never see her again .	8.571253568111556
an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth .	7.907557050684089
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents .	20.281784384323473
-- your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr. collins , and i will never see you again if you do .	677.2077451966146
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but mrs. bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .	19808.88111643135
what do you mean , mr. bennet , by talking in this way ?	22.684795886450704
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him .	9.706035375207357
my dear replied her husband , i have two small favours to request .	26.359083733179176
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .	1021.1050687050908
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be .	35.01091869649245
not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs. bennet give up the point .	212.56869076905372
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .	53.61562950915799
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; -- and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .	43358.22490687261
though her manner varied however , her determination never did .	16.642564425839595
mr. collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	24.99834937664638
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .	8601.064101198011
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .	555.7034149769903
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .	160.95573313079075
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !	14993.964037662761
-- what do you think has happened this morning ?	8.97614054349363
-- mr. collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him .	66.10644854292627
charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where mrs. bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	1210168336.4357972
pray do , my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone , for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves .	88376.75617701573
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .	15.107446110821513
aye , there she comes continued mrs. bennet , looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way .	51341.784044100685
-- but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead .	13898758.200180128
-- i shall not be able to keep you -- and so i warn you .	30.160179292610657
-- i have done with you from this very day .	13.169729715121749
-- i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .	3150.9201948519158
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .	6.486672977538911
-- not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .	24.44131520405215
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .	91.66495873307336
nobody can tell what i suffer !	3.7028131371102884
-- but it is always so .	3.1185638523814463
those who do not complain are never pitied .	7.466210067710969
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .	1665.011986687792
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr. collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls ,	82497.76446961479
now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together .	3713.1721951847767
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr. collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	2802722283.221538
in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected conversation .	23.207984781998633
-- oh !	1
mr. collins !	1
--	1
my dear madam replied he , let us be for ever silent on this point .	54.44238640651878
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , to resent the behaviour of your daughter .	964.7833702867522
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .	22943.331530618194
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .	6463135.191456673
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	4030305.3072399125
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .	484.55680491503927
but we are all liable to error .	4.650037465375103
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair .	9.522325091996423
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise .	115760.89294878652
chapter xxi.	1
the discussion of mr. collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	33284.77896469014
as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .	34957.998534459264
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .	1446812.732672293
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet's ill humour or ill health .	46.55819729134644
mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride .	13.958320923127152
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	566.0395807808111
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay .	112.77764224448131
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball .	2207.910144193303
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over .	10113.351760678908
-- to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .	145.2498224514829
i found said he , as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr. darcy ; -- that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .	14581515.46895316
she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .	8463776.72627294
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	14425.77868399409
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .	317.3645466255253
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .	1417297.7451770476
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .	442412674.41480964
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said ,	47.775057500538786
this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .	114.01653370676561
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .	1175.3210237716178
you shall hear what she says .	3.4631765265062735
she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr. hurst had a house .	957953.618243018
the next was in these words .	3.569182186097543
i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .	314399019.09952796
i depend on you for that .	4.097695028817828
to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .	7386910389.10967
it is unlucky said she , after a short pause , that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	1112.8405139483007
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ?	2240213.086644162
-- mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them .	12.564092249922114
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter .	42.60483895826095
i will read it to you --	3.460043318488437
when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .	77994348963.00366
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair .	54263.34650060964
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you .	813185.8273592085
it is evident by this added jane , that he comes back no more this winter .	65.76351848796689
it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should .	21.487915069934914
why will you think so ?	2.612152064937454
it must be his own doing .	3.217762731352444
-- he is his own master .	3.468672692416113
but you do not know all .	2.6595497161333372
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	15.195018116910154
i will have no reserves from you .	5.762526509638896
mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .	553.2655964734033
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	4729623.7993261125
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .	20238.568700857748
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .	29246129.20156754
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ?	98211.2428116385
what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy ?	9.439117481011504
-- said jane as she finished it .	4.275345731014451
is it not clear enough ?	2.835970681321008
-- does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly !	617921.4850455915
) to put me on my guard ?	5.705531449793923
can there be any other opinion on the subject ?	7.867900726831952
yes , there can ; for mine is totally different .	13.298835263669206
-- will you hear it ?	2.6110795697242963
most willingly .	1
you shall have it in few words .	5.800038764337902
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .	188.26652599615704
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .	1225.6964925819195
jane shook her head .	2.0413384604218776
indeed , jane , you ought to believe me .	8.240324588935097
-- no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .	66.71709657038316
miss bingley i am sure cannot .	2.7887710092408087
she is not such a simpleton .	2.8962667848565733
could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	440.82304073050994
but the case is this .	2.8767083279928647
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way .	1462922811.4682539
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend .	1719514330.5937097
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane , your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .	542.3831550476658
but i know the foundation is unjust .	5.401771553584697
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself .	855.7821730973552
that is right .	1.432695622157089
-- you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .	152.82611169818608
believe her to be deceived by all means .	5.011165950293044
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer .	36.92172904523675
but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ?	8816.200355281533
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth , and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him .	647552.6401523962
how can you talk so ?	2.2990612039888227
-- said jane faintly smiling , -- you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate .	968.5676341835026
i did not think you would ; -- and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion .	384.19209902449165
but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .	64.26889075454595
a thousand things may arise in six months !	8.07691795421503
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .	26.863433290742716
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	196127.2082947822
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .	1422.193794237277
jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	65506.980246959894
they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	150492593.950902
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .	37380651.31145697
chapter xxii.	1
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins .	4370.113147255111
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .	4.631642602398012
it keeps him in good humour said she , and i am more obliged to you than i can express .	180.7334246331211
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .	1179.075979781916
this was very amiable , but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; -- its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr. collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .	558991.4557600438
such was miss lucas's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .	79428.26757032277
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .	529149.767199576
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .	8594668104.140606
his reception however was of the most flattering kind .	9.48688092359626
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .	1630.7981349613835
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .	123.32266631540189
in as short a time as mr. collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .	2604082647.290683
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .	27572682.579340402
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .	537.9020449766784
mr. collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	11653.61247863155
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st .	1358380960.4406796
james's .	1
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	19.25292700756935
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid .	33826.707317661145
charlotte herself was tolerably composed .	2.868813713604877
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .	29.71187267636225
her reflections were in general satisfactory .	3.746363502115039
mr. collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	973.8355963240393
but still he would be her husband .	5.042237580176137
-- without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .	1715587.0362691856
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .	3728.468394901949
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .	5398.456593985856
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .	1733.1928242865017
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	35675.931467359806
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	751915624.5355657
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	480067135.69813216
my dear madam he replied , this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible .	58230.750721909026
they were all astonished ; and mr. bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said ,	351.4972816110472
but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ?	47.98832244884941
-- you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness .	113.89279791582159
my dear sir replied mr. collins , i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence .	14488.60510413803
you cannot be too much on your guard .	5.5414011251505455
risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence .	551479.6444219279
believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire .	1974421.7038048594
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth .	58839.0730947259
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .	526.0915555284226
mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .	5640.813716677088
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .	31250887.381318264
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .	45.12006109706468
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .	458.8738228348182
the possibility of mr. collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out ,	978251720.8286641
engaged to mr. collins !	1.6233364321662294
my dear charlotte , -- impossible !	3.401254648832052
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied ,	2434811.4864582815
why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ?	6.071720850758349
-- do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ?	2667.4119507902246
but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .	256749.13250609644
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte , -- you must be surprised , very much surprised , -- so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you .	5134.265164772112
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .	336.9723759649315
i am not romantic you know .	2.994921345671531
i never was .	1.4342391892963828
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering mr. collins's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state .	638987.8235897844
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly -- and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	216.00585628741686
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .	258.3912666740027
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .	169.79274694525418
the strangeness of mr. collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	597.327306447768
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .	146008.20363783825
charlotte the wife of mr. collins , was a most humiliating picture !	16.521765655725613
-- and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	141525.74881374004
chapter xxiii.	1
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .	657536.7832380785
with many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , -- to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed ,	298904750.8307512
good lord !	1
sir william , how can you tell such a story ?	9.418458932611768
-- do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ?	21.156661889558546
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .	12082196.217915503
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .	108011499192231.34
mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .	12383.635243038778
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .	2201445.994501809
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	6027179.631292173
nothing could console and nothing appease her .	5.823267289106672
-- nor did that day wear out her resentment .	10.7309373462182
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .	472123.72339646367
mr. bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !	218899649.2334619
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .	63313.04907465926
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .	43322.327815100056
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .	30182942.830719404
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .	5966.088225627488
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	20236995.656158965
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .	987.1794847159773
the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .	34285.324252096594
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	4.693870190117097e+16
mr. collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .	63.607248707726505
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .	39.01409186225716
-- it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .	903.2998810054953
-- she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .	1603.8716286389501
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley's continued absence .	523.1864308330919
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	9.258099683189206
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .	9848833.16421303
even elizabeth began to fear -- not that bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .	949.153287661365
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	7789.2217479639385
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .	172681.05169721707
as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .	597272.7568365848
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	1619581.474557876
it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	46.63611741527761
mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .	2569.3252412628935
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company .	7680.277820318403
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .	34008.759344909275
mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state .	8.014173412803952
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	8044.387961867771
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her .	9.478725157516118
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	47.912621939663985
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr. bennet were dead .	29871370.559109
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband .	8.000117283842814
indeed , mr. bennet said she , it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it !	204638.94790070318
my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .	11.49414020747145
let us hope for better things .	3.765900175891715
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor .	13.242793190683303
this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before ,	337.4073684336709
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	16.031284426807154
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it .	18.861095191883308
what should not you mind ?	2.606310935968106
i should not mind any thing at all .	5.950518068502133
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility .	42.421859108213965
i never can be thankful , mr. bennet , for any thing about the entail .	56.63849747044646
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr. collins too !	4018.3615574148903
-- why should he have it more than anybody else ?	12.903581134446787
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr. bennet .	12.112122642542849

pride & prejudice.	1
chapter i.	1
miss bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .	15.072454590131413
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country .	475550.623523171
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .	40239.52632195743
miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .	7.015050512790092
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	45935.64182518113
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of mr. darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	12936.988385088613
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .	158.69875867680003
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .	71.51103377786961
to caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .	61.04737936305797
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .	10729074284.824215
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	414656.1170653816
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .	227.1613770592269
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .	2438212858.9591446
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mrs. bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying ,	378809.08703942026
oh !	1
that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .	3496.701109798343
but i will not repine .	2.2216100366786358
it cannot last long .	2.0293403029854162
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .	44.600612651099766
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .	19.701812271034964
you doubt me cried jane , slightly colouring ; indeed you have no reason .	50.83807804474221
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .	156.7201361772587
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .	63.572986591975436
thank god !	1
i have not that pain .	2.2155456467713432
a little time therefore .	2.028876909493667
-- i shall certainly try to get the better .	6.899196116764889
with a stronger voice she soon added , i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself .	140604.22009519843
my dear jane !	1.1443731754760333
exclaimed elizabeth , you are too good .	4.028400044774804
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you .	100.11886076575902
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve .	150.43324798684992
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .	272.2656052368576
nay said elizabeth , this is not fair .	4.5119345214307165
you wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body .	218.17863166997674
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .	52.767017017215686
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .	524.6199385553887
you need not .	1.2335777404465242
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well .	107.16954037953127
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .	1530936.1809206828
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte's marriage .	243.5108623960318
it is unaccountable !	1.3400883533278956
in every view it is unaccountable !	3.8129193366726652
my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .	19.35141716231114
they will ruin your happiness .	2.87346900882353
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .	23.3481177369033
consider mr. collins's respectability , and charlotte's prudent , steady character .	23.99236242346816
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin .	587295.765325599
to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart .	14094654.083019935
my dear jane , mr. collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .	2822451.4859834653
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas .	16.7394761286934
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness .	247604.17619938133
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane , and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .	2774.1935242150694
but enough of this .	2.0291728902435007
you alluded to something else .	2.8635746493789447
you mentioned two instances .	2.028375712074572
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	13492.659265568278
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .	11.498116194335376
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .	50.26516216018437
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us .	25.021131208600632
women fancy admiration means more than it does .	8.140990845088371
and men take care that they should .	5.00132918500523
if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .	4583.342724980388
i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley's conduct to design said elizabeth ; but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .	101711.69875447048
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business .	278.00904628824344
and do you impute it to either of those ?	10.116437029521016
yes ; to the last .	2.3494899126431714
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem .	233.70768940233347
stop me whilst you can .	2.8767949251277276
you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him .	20.359597740114868
yes , in conjunction with his friend .	4.962091655963506
i cannot believe it .	1.8812853898376656
why should they try to influence him ?	5.272310348146155
they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it .	393.05713555230784
your first position is false .	2.874258709513354
they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride .	221442.25015327413
beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane ; but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .	1799.5308541729878
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .	296.1526596724588
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .	218.30094338145062
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?	145.12318617648228
if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .	1248.3012342977854
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	328.6836999150795
do not distress me by the idea .	5.4429322054271925
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	16173.335633728713
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood .	114.74013163437752
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time mr. bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .	342.67171155349325
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .	318410.5939968514
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .	107037276.70578448
mrs. bennet's best comfort was , that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer .	83.64321060640893
mr. bennet treated the matter differently .	4.095023237718763
so , lizzy said he one day , your sister is crossed in love i find .	71.00446042719514
i congratulate her .	1.4342389748506241
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .	203.09432595536543
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .	115.34103307982335
when is your turn to come ?	3.1753106798801896
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane .	12.0937114978032
now is your time .	2.0294387730395416
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .	71.58572721120906
let wickham be your man .	2.8739928547520615
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably .	12.15184633032841
thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .	35.801251346545456
we must not all expect jane's good fortune .	6.723727049123069
true said mr. bennet , but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .	22272.476187957735
mr. wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family .	1806.6579898104087
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	116.41336201776932
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr. darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .	8745086.56658294
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes -- but by everybody else mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men .	39223808.06863284
chapter ii.	1
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr. collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday .	2027.150313677378
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .	8451720.983615944
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .	11813.31465811402
on the following monday , mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn .	1353.381191402148
mr. gardiner was a sensible , gentleman-like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .	358.4873969256976
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	14410.657358970351
mrs. gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs. bennet and mrs. philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces .	13686.679056652009
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .	54.81459522259375
they had frequently been staying with her in town .	10.133017856775314
the first part of mrs. gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .	582.7610358792901
when this was done , she had a less active part to play .	29.878302639471666
it became her turn to listen .	4.098229356799394
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .	30.72915379532541
they had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister .	27.599520865549902
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .	122.30412212529734
i do not blame jane she continued , for jane would have got mr. bingley , if she could .	112.15598869289488
but , lizzy !	1.234111141119658
oh , sister !	1.4169593704706622
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr. collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .	851.9448745678224
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	36.144724193252365
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .	3090.4144241172467
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .	10.164056578778556
they are all for what they can get .	7.1937190726239
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	25.45614412062845
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .	2948.5292824049943
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves .	4579.941863357866
mrs. gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .	74474.4404487398
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .	28.81143852691807
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she .	28.983622573058994
i am sorry it went off .	2.972725316801824
but these things happen so often !	4.017268685418034
a young man , such as you describe mr. bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent .	219955.29625008095
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth , but it will not do for us .	69.82714766142895
we do not suffer by accident .	3.539983380997444
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before .	69176.2085118166
but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .	1482.1049729865476
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .	602.3086094434138
pray , how violent was mr. bingley's love ?	8.067647852078757
i never saw a more promising inclination .	4.565682016889662
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	57.6521320730104
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .	13.821910730446463
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .	7307.587189128923
could there be finer symptoms ?	2.4654719720438294
is not general incivility the very essence of love ?	11.579863520765592
oh , yes !	1.3219882805632093
-- of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt .	34.236910885894446
poor jane !	1
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .	165.43555908798248
it had better have happened to you lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .	162.6340011704215
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?	29.218252267762722
change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything .	684.2340936116561
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .	100.90904162649134
i hope added mrs. gardiner , that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .	145.21108400976752
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .	2334009.0152120646
and that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london !	22272.170390557414
my dear aunt , how could you think of it ?	9.612104260980322
mr. darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , mr. bingley never stirs without him .	1638335.9794589996
so much the better .	1.5542828691099189
i hope they will not meet at all .	6.672679122424143
but does not jane correspond with the sister ?	8.13351167024922
she will not be able to help calling .	3.5239236064427004
she will drop the acquaintance entirely .	4.096126238983735
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .	4337319.078670432
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re-animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions .	27210.690268465398
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	13250215.241855161
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .	1781.271205112723
mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .	1014.5763729687995
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mrs. gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	1530332.4239057938
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .	16312154.650991946
to mrs. gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	133.41773400873834
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged .	4876.108153086452
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .	5712537.685073545
mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr. darcy by character perfectly well .	72.93359779989223
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .	8.19821969385556
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself .	97865.2715735032
on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill-natured boy .	36568091.07913194
chapter iii.	1
mrs. gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on	18474.97451504634
you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly .	4851.51908028036
seriously , i would have you be on your guard .	12.1606335717129
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .	917.8830152987954
i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better .	6602.912679444997
but as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you .	50.23262568162587
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	23.201934149069967
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure .	55.37948526369707
you must not disappoint your father .	3.2325434872669128
my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed .	6.212975099511561
yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise .	22.395774692670614
well , then , you need not be under any alarm .	15.09482550165736
i will take care of myself , and of mr. wickham too .	14.30442019042456
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it .	17.664991593744826
elizabeth , you are not serious now .	4.194267177008625
i beg your pardon .	1.4152177505107186
i will try again .	1.864262968800951
at present i am not in love with mr. wickham ; no , i certainly am not .	66.67362397408469
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- i believe it will be better that he should not .	20894.11232908191
i see the imprudence of it .	3.4892389082585225
-- oh !	1
that abominable mr. darcy !	2.0039289012505974
-- my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it .	242.23788410467478
my father , however , is partial to mr. wickham .	8.11367893682166
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?	208610594889.90384
all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .	30.79490686236574
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .	24.179338303998033
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .	17.802109604592534
in short , i will do my best .	4.712963129357131
perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .	73.46662222598482
at least , you should not remind your mother of inviting him .	24.820921896280314
as i did the other day said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .	1683.590946370716
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .	15.341300539446095
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .	54.063521585470454
you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .	56.54152675859248
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied .	2052.436819838388
her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .	69746.35328881485
mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet .	67647.60214601624
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she wished they might be happy .	46520.75436736207
thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .	2264112.901973444
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said ,	9.447343858575067
i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza .	19.794758915399278
that you certainly shall .	2.0289730746052097
and i have another favour to ask .	4.532290286335116
will you come and see me ?	4.048596882596602
we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire .	14.610836398055275
i am not likely to leave kent for some time .	8.592128089107895
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford .	7.728193093356595
elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .	24.18584469841144
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte , and i hope you will consent to be of the party .	787.1140922733169
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them .	40.72004001392471
the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .	23319.462356951506
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .	4597.508054365891
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	78155.85147012275
charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .	1845172937.0026157
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .	99.35545694836331
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .	1463.4655444203484
it was mr. collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	6192.275139171839
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys .	43420.913364897235
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	55.60170762302206
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline .	56.51997557571957
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost .	1152.5997042913502
my aunt she continued , is going to-morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street .	829.5997983924829
she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley .	43.95970432133697
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words , but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london .	11372.626534440593
i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .	47.47902079959964
i enquired after their brother , of course .	7.516165189718704
he was well , but so much engaged with mr. darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .	94.1296997247049
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner .	8.201574105993572
i wish i could see her .	2.977892211165959
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out .	52.58523512646019
i dare say i shall soon see them here .	8.588519992559927
elizabeth shook her head over this letter .	4.834361870600483
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister's being in town .	120.32851778609177
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him .	16.228412729172497
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention .	373.20293023276736
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer .	12680391.774300942
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .	115.55113545252011
my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me .	55414.72098646569
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .	129381.85921417698
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again .	19276.64533946923
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time .	2403.398213916779
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .	355403466.9896652
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her .	8.198479412002783
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .	2283.2064982810675
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .	11078.868162918487
i need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .	55884930.98589267
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .	26103.51201465478
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy .	221792.18355422854
i cannot understand it .	1.881291877316455
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .	1956.8094992602678
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .	12149.217290834617
let me hear from you very soon .	4.619691039435318
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	651.2434709991335
we had better not mention it .	3.4419369171245857
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .	73.82775508083627
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria .	14.839922358114771
i am sure you will be very comfortable there .	5.29162045191455
your's , &c .	1.2318354519587884
this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	2479.178884048889
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .	10.685086623285324
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .	13.681995808850894
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr. darcy's sister , as , by wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .	7708580.447212458
mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .	44751.75623702087
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .	186.10978510032015
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .	443.68626231673915
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .	2826.4922279552375
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	1824672.2783836205
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .	1654613.6454630573
all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on -- i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	116073882.04416823
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king .	113.93022482042039
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .	1395.6411673236914
there can be no love in all this .	6.940553270535677
my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance .	55112.166716232234
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .	5.752393244284375
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do .	34.16532395604565
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain .	25054.234307281495
chapter iv.	1
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away .	50428.287986925854
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford .	5.798344126085431
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	189041.0134438048
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr. collins .	108.74545860529571
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .	34060.01921422468
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .	6096.245323516721
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch .	118.8692464424124
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter .	10.796711580618346
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	520.6302780408489
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .	719316.1657267746
the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .	68.54704878198453
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	1.4380291478571891e+17
her fellow-travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	114.02366799234665
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty-headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .	475210.5579717965
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william's too long .	17.600665266630664
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information .	1629.1722210359915
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch-street by noon .	442.30540728644695
as they drove to mr. gardiner's door , jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	2146927.721191527
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .	1267140.1574617792
all was joy and kindness .	2.8876883980260746
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	442.27826444879116
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .	7.666447704385726
their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .	103252.4399917917
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .	33.77678896504795
mrs. gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .	510457.4900675013
mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .	273.2110438531216
but , my dear elizabeth she added , what sort of girl is miss king ?	35.51798285444516
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary .	9.209979337830058
pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?	300.6930727644468
where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?	7.5410714223038084
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary .	141793.93198330395
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think .	222.98795521588252
she is a very good kind of girl , i believe .	12.41167857859694
i know no harm of her .	3.8610252221232404
but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune .	265.0644367730523
no -- why should he ?	2.471659763403105
if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ?	137254.50918793373
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event .	102.29026361307871
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	210.5676793287772
if she does not object to it , why should we ?	10.694961106359589
her not objecting , does not justify him .	7.222168260143832
it only shews her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling .	46.750795939376374
well cried elizabeth , have it as you choose .	8.497947427303172
he shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .	12.173163713215155
no , lizzy , that is what i do not choose .	8.073526241924819
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire .	250.46331689808568
oh !	1
if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better .	6442.418873147198
i am sick of them all .	3.131009291367781
thank heaven !	1
i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	2553.2976925461276
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all .	22.225728762512137
take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment .	23.405040568920505
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .	54781.55630137643
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs. gardiner , but perhaps to the lakes .	255.1893778146865
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .	264.8399132960171
my dear , dear aunt she rapturously cried , what delight !	18.498494788824463
what felicity !	1
you give me fresh life and vigour .	5.304584370860951
adieu to disappointment and spleen .	2.8915733306743885
what are men to rocks and mountains ?	5.777939287588168
oh !	1
what hours of transport we shall spend !	5.674050263307482
and when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .	1227.7921298058532
we will know where we have gone -- we will recollect what we have seen .	82.64499027331253
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .	73966.35001926374
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers .	53.399868484376654
chapter v.	1
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .	9861625.758692088
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	8359.755664925795
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side .	18.88722223268206
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .	40.514745006661016
at length the parsonage was discernible .	3.7315932759611545
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	3861.1013358295127
mr. collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .	60758.955123364765
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .	83.39591899439732
mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .	3161.3290905676618
she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .	571141.8511366365
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .	27240105.77080761
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .	3848197.466169652
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .	564747.3902486218
when mr. collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .	5454.32337975653
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear .	175.10809228885196
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	217413066.1826823
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .	250783.42518445343
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .	335097.54037654586
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	640.1120980928063
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .	3010071.9611902465
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .	23.467751875023012
from his garden , mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .	943686721.5359358
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit .	23065.28974889639
when mr. collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .	8644.811588509227
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country .	24.23882002550859
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr. collins joining in , observed ,	161.72603990671206
yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her .	7589.6063793946405
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .	1222.9318572766992
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .	6178.871125530809
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .	6.346516901397241
we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .	64.30346529482894
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .	7.498945801261884
i should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several .	40.54563619724467
lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed added charlotte , and a most attentive neighbour .	107.62709559786323
very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say .	14.859734376008108
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference .	45.6242372081671
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	737202929.4440411
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr. collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings .	39611.6342793185
a lively imagination soon settled it all .	5.768055614002194
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .	21658438.744288884
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out ,	494.3129781894455
oh , my dear eliza !	1.9105755136469593
pray make haste and come into the dining-room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	97.3533362207672
i will not tell you what it is .	5.288648095886931
make haste , and come down this moment .	6.676493826534807
elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining-room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .	450705.21267110825
and is this all ?	2.0078808788376743
cried elizabeth .	1
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter !	589.4327102170589
la !	1
my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake , it is not lady catherine .	53.413412428408435
the old lady is mrs. jenkinson , who lives with them .	19.943894383447795
the other is miss de bourgh .	3.0230029791850885
only look at her .	2.0401104492918374
she is quite a little creature .	3.7452708431630346
who would have thought she could be so thin and small !	13.252885481108189
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind .	47.00704222447565
why does she not come in ?	4.039698029428337
oh !	1
charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	5.759932835006034
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in .	16.995281024297135
i like her appearance said elizabeth , struck with other ideas .	17.53252461509344
she looks sickly and cross .	2.89161047924736
-- yes , she will do for him very well .	11.929213266630661
she will make him a very proper wife .	7.124436232367886
mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .	6601697.17892562
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .	313.72415287761504
mr. collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day .	93516.00861505646
chapter vi.	1
mr. collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .	12.822291332362843
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .	143316468.01879418
i confess said he , that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings .	5435.366269837857
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .	65.07470976239502
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?	13.053038137928624
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival !	2568.4595798761216
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william , from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .	52311.36481063941
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon .	33.535545347471064
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings .	121.86483839302097
mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	17724.645707654847
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth ,	28.79637635982192
do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	29.04775195853766
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .	241.47747041502987
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .	1287.3272390497943
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	42.13109404960969
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved .	8.363679438984699
while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner .	41386.61281054505
-- such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st .	2592014.293315354
james's .	1
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park .	273.96828534460815
-- every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .	704924949.9326366
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm .	1564.4721870962471
-- elizabeth's courage did not fail her .	5.777504742376974
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .	30711.707302682786
from the entrance hall , of which mr. collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti-chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs. jenkinson were sitting .	1228406.7463674762
-- her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .	5405716.068451582
in spite of having been at st .	3.987473707526475
james's , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	125152656.38929692
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly .	183.01040011163926
-- lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly-marked features , which might once have been handsome .	311.877985164788
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	1008.7889308294541
she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self-importance , and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented .	12521801.93769185
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	1251527.8835344922
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .	47.54377896657714
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs. jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .	320843521.8801723
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .	1103996.6483849
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .	89721845.50328553
-- he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear .	10843639.648564177
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .	4855.948204338686
the party did not supply much conversation .	5.748480224050167
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .	632643.4302798574
mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .	4391.993969746618
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .	74.24387866216576
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .	8512878.783827147
she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .	26687011.788405713
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .	805.5096985541904
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs. collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs. collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .	4418601.904339307
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother's maiden name ?	20599719.999577016
-- elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly .	77.84794440156288
-- lady catherine then observed ,	2.6433481472078095
your father's estate is entailed on mr. collins , i think .	16.99121107695412
for your sake turning to charlotte , i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line .	1091.8955152887627
-- it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family .	17.108336946051768
-- do you play and sing , miss bennet ?	8.56155405244224
a little .	1
oh !	1
then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .	28.162737292502577
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day .	191.86936519797533
-- do your sisters play and sing ?	5.001011769020267
one of them does .	1.6000164242961108
why did not you all learn ?	2.911916033388318
-- you ought all to have learned .	5.8194630967505665
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's .	144.35702460193522
-- do you draw ?	1.6854241140994595
no , not at all .	2.4753985548561093
what , none of you ?	2.869940851000286
not one .	1
that is very strange .	1.6662553109859695
but i suppose you had no opportunity .	4.224399965645851
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters .	95.56781375191453
my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london .	33.465630340484644
has your governess left you ?	2.8428863629853756
we never had any governess .	2.6342845513547273
no governess !	1
how was that possible ?	2.004410054247049
five daughters brought up at home without a governess !	10.534635624995461
-- i never heard of such a thing .	5.000696013782453
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education .	18.483362253259155
elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .	56.2445203269375
then , who taught you ?	2.842046139085879
who attended to you ?	2.008576404678735
without a governess you must have been neglected .	4.881856201271868
compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	1035.1630351774552
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .	49.157180329314556
those who chose to be idle , certainly might .	9.142018392397038
aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .	11308.490392448331
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .	2442.779194661624
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way .	65.62535899406768
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out .	25.494701194212787
four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	363214.4864155817
mrs. collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?	63.022297430927686
she finds miss pope a treasure .	4.077504024868269
'lady catherine , ' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .'	34.14804982762357
are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ?	14.190309352145846
yes , ma'am , all .	2.2190970840230264
all !	1
-- what , all five out at once ?	8.062632071446545
very odd !	1
-- and you only the second .	4.097957361736204
-- the younger ones out before the elder are married !	13.644802618756914
-- your younger sisters must be very young ?	6.7876403380884724
yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	5.760386055972012
perhaps she is full young to be much in company .	15.352103235756108
but really , ma'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early .	116131.07681583869
-- the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .	139.13696993045116
and to be kept back on such a motive !	7.681362570897355
-- i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind .	111.6441375789019
upon my word said her ladyship , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person .	188.23719333985184
-- pray , what is your age ?	4.525163382811472
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling , your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .	304.520837426695
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .	11279.342091667468
you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , -- therefore you need not conceal your age .	173.50970898460102
i am not one and twenty .	3.119783565184364
when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .	73.9259487706041
lady catherine , sir william , and mr. and mrs. collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her party .	87378.44515732472
their table was superlatively stupid .	2.868592638708167
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	292357.90631187614
a great deal more passed at the other table .	7.0057568893822095
lady catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .	425.7237142657026
mr. collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .	10852.398313973084
sir william did not say much .	3.24438741229744
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .	16.490526560302754
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs. collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	14790.033613251624
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .	490.17068951126697
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr. collins's side , and as many bows on sir william's , they departed .	21052.13164045049
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .	245207.0208032828
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr. collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands .	18562.28973474701
chapter vii.	1
sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .	528990.953251628
while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	37975448908919.586
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards .	9.34510310878572
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .	15468055835.930525
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	11404545.980714146
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .	1305.8637801998584
very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .	16952001.915370513
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .	1851.7965488551456
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .	677815796.4946662
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	461490773488.3885
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .	356236.95053264435
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses' reach .	690.2830682796189
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .	3775906.8386502652
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity .	23753829.582283493
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .	50.747282434025024
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .	5714.644943008501
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .	8369554522785116.0
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .	23410002.78486986
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .	26.649087414949715
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr. collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .	1778878.1826862085
charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding ,	14192.854893092914
i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility .	23.173979349998657
mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me .	25.728919275435615
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door-bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .	14835.746656577378
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .	1461.7483048067002
mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs. collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .	302517.1010026803
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	9.96250447336836
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .	2719707.112392156
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family .	475.8977761554799
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added ,	44.13767828040683
my eldest sister has been in town these three months .	13.928484864275749
have you never happened to see her there ?	5.891494733736971
she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .	3958724.222213993
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .	29.937892078167
chapter viii.	1
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings .	3882.8091487785414
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .	425115175.0535474
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter .	91.1664473302722
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr. darcy they had only seen at church .	685.926252164566
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing-room .	322.924323855177
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .	22295626.44544024
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs. collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	19343.87406755184
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr. darcy .	562687562.1226594
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out ,	161525.21090963754
what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ?	6.528930400806879
what is it you are talking of ?	5.359151070141085
what are you telling miss bennet ?	3.6784240283755323
let me hear what it is .	3.8352874459929955
we are speaking of music , madam said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .	131.60065413994843
of music !	1
then pray speak aloud .	2.028449257849426
it is of all subjects my delight .	5.036999164194908
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .	45.50920436519508
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	1423.7477132041613
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient .	17.25797441549125
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	36.88490152461234
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully .	7.982626582438111
how does georgiana get on , darcy ?	5.792767184079103
mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .	15.158714119368863
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine ; and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal .	58011.464167505976
i assure you , madam he replied , that she does not need such advice .	25.508847667353525
she practises very constantly .	2.0283535397205914
so much the better .	1.5542828691099189
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	1202.6394108063773
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .	201.39494613278362
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though mrs. collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano-forte in mrs. jenkinson's room .	15485235.338464757
she would be in nobody's way , you know , in that part of the house .	35.83365139289883
mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .	86.48394726690672
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .	851.6037274991272
he drew a chair near her .	4.074393128265978
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .	9430814.452013409
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said ,	1063.5470420070635
you mean to frighten me , mr. darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?	152.72920832630396
but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .	32.374604680565064
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .	149.5779964842477
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me .	14.09055719353687
i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied , because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own .	6169989.828881355
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say .	41552.007574588504
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .	77379.12539084775
indeed , mr. darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear .	25078067.86971253
i am not afraid of you said he , smilingly .	6.764437347003184
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam .	37.36353964319986
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers .	11.879632796473821
you shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .	30.075496293467232
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	7002.846638386265
he danced only four dances !	2.3461736826785793
i am sorry to pain you -- but so it was .	16.260863013598076
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .	10166.103329176765
mr. darcy , you cannot deny the fact .	5.3580329204639785
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party .	192.4411254825309
true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .	30.225271714978597
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ?	10.141154334329128
my fingers wait your orders .	2.8663500495069587
perhaps said darcy , i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers .	1600.013361495268
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ?	9.29555567799277
said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam .	4.284426684159857
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?	2131.5074483267795
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam , without applying to him .	28.86287863382927
it is because he will not give himself the trouble .	14.317659666848076
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy , of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .	653.597177230224
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done .	337.1205927757164
my fingers said elizabeth , do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do .	636.3405443532715
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .	90.47556625454426
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because i would not take the trouble of practising .	407.0005995329726
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution .	143.93440465322553
darcy smiled and said , you are perfectly right .	8.616479487028624
you have employed your time much better .	5.752193596184969
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .	81.5610350514579
we neither of us perform to strangers .	5.795848883674659
here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .	102.98164765228246
elizabeth immediately began playing again .	2.870966478010321
lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy ,	64.13739948969385
miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master .	479.74899478902574
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne's .	108.76990221265056
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn .	55.8261824181066
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation .	365171857.34376055
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .	271.65925210067064
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .	9145.79961433196
chapter ix.	1
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .	554910.5537974022
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr. darcy , and mr. darcy only , entered the room .	28428592.813181832
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .	6280.336644079208
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .	548.0707058882595
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed ,	296620.90857489285
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr. darcy !	27.159411398012523
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before .	9753.417639167219
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london .	21.56117443779769
perfectly so -- i thank you .	3.4948417085430683
she found that she was to receive no other answer -- and , after a short pause , added ,	146.72826164338198
i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ?	143.8456782021314
i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .	689.5284016738431
he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing .	301.6300499310062
if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .	47382.65270743747
but perhaps mr. bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle .	41058.40653868636
i should not be surprised said darcy , if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .	242.0001037265687
elizabeth made no answer .	2.047665750633099
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .	4027.2524924662002
he took the hint , and soon began with , this seems a very comfortable house .	90.80385627904649
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr. collins first came to hunsford .	140.92783326465948
i believe she did -- and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object .	344.50335854326227
mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife .	18.822871422517316
yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .	45490.15648925396
my friend has an excellent understanding -- though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest thing she ever did .	2492.9329471909327
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her .	319.3523630326097
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends .	273.2142228211743
an easy distance do you call it ?	5.27493992527837
it is nearly fifty miles .	2.8688235843838843
and what is fifty miles of good road ?	7.0506567420636195
little more than half a day's journey .	4.006877449946333
yes , i call it a very easy distance .	9.32609390271489
i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth .	90.28641976713162
i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near her family .	30.775108713342366
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire .	8.813095674043891
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far .	61.0819396158024
as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered ,	15852.422909630981
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .	82.65538302911054
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .	82.9627340367037
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .	118.72100398380583
but that is not the case here .	3.441412861140303
mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance .	243374.32881825487
mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .	853.7686449678064
you cannot have been always at longbourn .	4.843088226361638
elizabeth looked surprised .	1.4342396427684754
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice ,	17308.160750255145
are you pleased with kent ?	2.8460519073831274
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .	51109.535301125106
the tête-à-tête surprised them .	2.03219443915687
mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	4069.903908809478
what can be the meaning of this !	3.5896344845930037
said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .	4.514959890811062
my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way .	411.75661851798355
but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .	58375342.670745224
all field sports were over .	2.8717908747223397
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	157028336.94472742
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .	855.3068656533325
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .	120336051633.95473
but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .	106.84860712266367
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .	1578741.6896799
he seldom appeared really animated .	2.8695489085838304
mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .	8.546955950517921
colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out .	122120295.4618853
-- she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .	354.79262952233273
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .	111.92566286449984
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	4543.182505727504
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	9402721452.659872
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .	61.61416671597112
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .	674669.7787186914
chapter x.	1
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr. darcy .	86.2337592472789
-- she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers .	510562.87106748624
-- how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd !	26.198516128804076
-- yet it did , and even a third .	8.219023585438764
it seemed like wilful ill-nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .	733770.0046367658
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .	2904173806812.647
his words seemed to imply it .	4.1184566295778575
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?	8.094082598078593
she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .	359.0969100698473
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage .	662.1869024497099
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re-perusing jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .	4626920.659367502
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said ,	28.11140655071735
i did not know before that you ever walked this way .	19.22909454288616
i have been making the tour of the park he replied , as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage .	5113.836158539323
are you going much farther ?	2.837656539831233
no , i should have turned in a moment .	7.244522345182066
and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .	31.380435100911498
do you certainly leave kent on saturday ?	5.687399460950293
said she .	1
yes -- if darcy does not put it off again .	13.77835055067794
but i am at his disposal .	2.9135694898390856
he arranges the business just as he pleases .	6.578275572850154
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .	447.6147637624643
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy .	424.73395587573043
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam .	27.633708139486473
but so we all do .	2.4969074320790523
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .	1384.0614805069572
i speak feelingly .	1.4342431298341614
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self-denial and dependence .	39.56490761219718
in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .	86.4836373977092
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence ?	37.7375441142931
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ?	1829.229295687674
these are home questions -- and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature .	178.33217027954436
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .	47.769348396208535
younger sons cannot marry where they like .	5.428087766064694
unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do .	54.30031500700195
our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money .	7236.198769114894
is this thought elizabeth , meant for me ?	6.589223081340341
and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , and pray , what is the usual price of an earl's younger son ?	11053.949555245004
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds .	140.0439681656789
he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .	15.021109934034763
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said ,	339.5918595021191
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .	218.3693361573192
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .	70.36222246370835
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her .	6882.9407630184405
no said colonel fitzwilliam , that is an advantage which he must divide with me .	47.20817935500076
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy .	13.391583987055728
are you , indeed ?	2.0032816451908873
and pray what sort of guardians do you make ?	8.488125616628318
does your charge give you much trouble ?	5.692566828133168
young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way .	9546.23228338517
as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .	612483.125620149
she directly replied ,	1.4399002375069714
you need not be frightened .	2.4992932957645984
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .	247.3477621038888
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs. hurst and miss bingley .	103.56826913505598
i think i have heard you say that you know them .	15.222430698894666
i know them a little .	2.8831326056063395
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man -- he is a great friend of darcy's .	48.723151623720746
oh !	1
yes said elizabeth drily -- mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr. bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .	753.3590533915889
care of him !	1.236400954815695
-- yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .	246.38666226644733
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .	599.3934934597701
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .	208.257353938158
it was all conjecture .	1.6159339908449128
what is it you mean ?	2.644885238440978
it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing .	21956.959954338294
you may depend upon my not mentioning it .	6.947066040048836
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley .	34.6399444548004
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .	6591205789.012305
did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference ?	16.23243571610233
i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady .	20.362392449342494
and what arts did he use to separate them ?	11.527652092499103
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling .	25.8047290633611
he only told me , what i have now told you .	15.797964594352234
elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .	36.880601626359436
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .	49.10360585027557
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she .	17.483677982939092
your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .	8.143688046872574
why was he to be the judge ?	4.526324776954867
you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ?	11.511399150709554
i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy .	319766.7911826175
but she continued , recollecting herself , as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	344.53983268022233
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case .	18.1775588072902
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam , but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly .	337.9056180856756
this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr. darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .	380180.9854920647
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	973.907931935097
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	238.13747271834245
there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr. darcy could have such boundless influence .	227.4282832347796
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr. bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .	20263.040234944303
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .	22627.315415168265
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .	29128.422527696668
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london .	215017.68299715815
to jane herself she exclaimed , there could be no possibility of objection .	41.87946165928276
all loveliness and goodness as she is !	4.994102918471002
her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	24.021164922527426
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach .	45618.3720534282
when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr. darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr. bingley for his sister .	1288382161463.1997
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr. darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	11756202.50942049
mrs. collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr. collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .	1090434.0939877178
chapter xi.	1
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr. darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent .	155442.09600565815
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	513.7344718161175
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .	12266066.80838014
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .	569.0031194123374
mr. darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings .	617.9691899182366
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .	25032242.45264658
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	1481800.4461036392
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .	5732915.80099517
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr. darcy walk into the room .	5403.184656628552
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	2121.661176073805
she answered him with cold civility .	3.553980932567993
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	80.79257048530633
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .	6.6780431094036246
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began ,	192.86475541386784
in vain have i struggled .	2.8761916832238996
it will not do .	1.7012631888176473
my feelings will not be repressed .	3.073323901981541
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you .	34.63298582241092
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .	2.6263387519811334
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .	10.915938045663738
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	467.5428925114582
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .	6766.622535776406
his sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .	4017326.173648383
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .	61351064.52910207
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .	166.88814622860528
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .	256377.75196114788
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	105.44753923975233
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .	32.494626360025315
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said ,	647.7621847998284
in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .	15002.443047157245
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you .	429.0732733013513
but i cannot -- i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	188.16181893578593
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	11.642301580133156
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration .	59.39314002381315
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .	4129.433682297762
mr. darcy , who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .	2930.135499114418
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature .	167.45883071924422
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .	930.2040516786816
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful .	5.803964744842425
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said ,	20.33574303941294
and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !	32.21523448555874
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected .	489.48908097665344
but it is of small importance .	2.6496224727649915
i might as well enquire replied she , why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	763894.2934822108
was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ?	21.864899523101574
but i have other provocations .	2.320889409157182
you know i have .	1.8623202552046867
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?	6105534.57421894
as she pronounced these words , mr. darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .	3952.2160419219726
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	17.67663047462105
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .	33.16656606987769
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind .	77589989.4483785
she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .	2119.1165604383436
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .	17.74557983693746
can you deny that you have done it ?	5.331729282486929
she repeated .	1
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success .	21751.5707859707
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself .	8.646996838000986
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .	1295.6129108827859
but it is not merely this affair she continued , on which my dislike is founded .	61.422158796031646
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .	31.208530837314203
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr. wickham .	132.96290671921074
on this subject , what can you have to say ?	11.348728045774912
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?	21.08999108930374
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ?	19.497053465360004
you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .	682.4746614272836
who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ?	119.71264522068536
his misfortunes !	1
repeated darcy contemptuously ; yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed .	29.10055120350463
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy .	7.4727995932355995
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .	48.05648549711412
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .	80.85423884874875
you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .	1046.1074850416633
you have done all this !	2.284854706316129
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule .	57.22350942418914
and this cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , is your opinion of me !	233.3752204856635
this is the estimation in which you hold me !	9.656063205142969
i thank you for explaining it so fully .	7.507702427763824
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !	18.90588711648389
but perhaps added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	931374.543958077
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	642975.1972489279
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .	8.154379606813226
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .	10.799339175935032
they were natural and just .	2.8926232673068393
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?	24.82476443790674
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?	251.86190146254398
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said ,	647.9021554591155
you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner .	1523695.7712015563
she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued ,	33.92657248415355
you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it .	982.2009335517796
again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	134.0264730000342
she went on .	1.3539291755026082
from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry .	2363637792097.7944
you have said quite enough , madam .	5.831794011731845
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .	218.65943220530318
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .	624.8019441922539
and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .	1678.0414378495288
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	8.233791062076444
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .	178.5754533444901
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	120.60682280956357
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr. darcy !	12.175065393829131
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !	15.990423625867782
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !	391541.3282482287
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .	19.96491349405217
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .	1703771421.808807
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .	16777.06529713729
chapter xii.	1
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .	197.24109968734203
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .	249989.80922404412
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .	165633.56197600474
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	392.7838493166028
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .	13406.77279420406
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees .	9496.756013591192
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .	448662.3870817328
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .	481.88607886256585
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	4246.55769753963
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .	304960.4820448299
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ?	12.336483917677837
-- and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .	246.42993151907766
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .	422028.0594627169
-- the envelope itself was likewise full .	5.760253907336822
-- pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .	29.17959049523253
it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows --	117.39195129342039
be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .	78135.85045874059
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .	129767529.03454618
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .	22488.66005120777
two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	752.1909607194517
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr. bingley from your sister , -- and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham .	38724564.401638225
-- wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .	18412455076.827698
-- but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .	333189.78170448495
-- if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , i can only say that i am sorry .	34351.80297332453
-- the necessity must be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd .	46.62142168501606
-- i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country .	13389.601997439702
-- but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment .	902.8832433529159
-- i had often seen him in love before .	8.05741012240022
-- at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas's accidental information , that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .	717917.7834384246
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .	104.95350482858306
from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .	7475.206106477308
your sister i also watched .	2.4961997859782934
-- her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .	6413959.100410953
-- if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error .	62.879357425808415
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable .	21.526146671521985
-- if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .	2397.0257417466228
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .	1196517.6004116093
-- that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , -- but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears .	22679.257703666044
-- i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; -- i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason .	6167.357075631908
-- my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me .	5235098.281029787
-- but there were other causes of repugnance ; -- causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me .	288336.1104654282
-- these causes must be stated , though briefly .	11.720404550224492
-- the situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father .	574336.6379456684
-- pardon me .	1.4321545675144158
-- it pains me to offend you .	5.826467396788472
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both .	3116951284.262209
-- i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection .	1804518.6788832522
-- he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .	1467.5571905221634
-- the part which i acted , is now to be explained .	30.912722245771082
-- his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london .	1416226.3228744199
-- we accordingly went -- and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice .	3366.864966611979
-- i described , and enforced them earnestly .	8.34360624800933
-- but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .	1567357.9032232712
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard .	136.67516109157378
-- but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own .	246.82227864108785
-- to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .	125.32388686057696
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment .	657.4137371039602
-- i cannot blame myself for having done thus much .	14.979046402496541
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .	680608.7430458943
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it .	379.53148537096604
-- that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; -- but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger .	17168.714977380114
-- perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me .	23.951230387816995
-- it is done , however , and it was done for the best .	25.530044308377423
-- on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .	61.04516398398923
if i have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them .	32229.696034514025
-- with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr. wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	27064.38774168177
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	7488.849967662329
mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god-son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .	66694115.57060294
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; -- most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .	170911.54040558
my father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .	542216.4114757647
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .	456.0645767865104
the vicious propensities -- the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr. darcy could not have .	16341269.282197455
here again i shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell .	79.34646103273423
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .	3310.193969484977
it adds even another motive .	2.869499319472564
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .	1741200578.1965475
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .	8.580025855035265
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr. wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .	483983206.7091312
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .	7709.485208282528
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .	885.7356039106012
i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman .	11.417845456809452
the business was therefore soon settled .	4.061450033821867
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .	8647.472934346735
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .	5.745572728761156
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town .	177.36482571089147
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .	71108.87829511719
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	52865.52457971109
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .	154.67045230158547
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions .	173780476.19426754
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .	403.1453655716209
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .	23017.926582056934
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .	15.344082634064222
how he lived i know not .	3.427208129162171
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .	32.80143311144916
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .	14439.701515239512
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .	24.719419112749797
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .	2143.777133892896
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went mr. wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs. younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .	8501197451733486.0
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .	12746.233856530993
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .	581893.4142222629
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted .	14.085782189113223
regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr. wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge .	28160.785240771733
mr. wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	15568.596432282482
his revenge would have been complete indeed .	4.254205717008054
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr. wickham .	380586.31850650726
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	4954.767181125923
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .	2530.5458851962344
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .	31.59406340319264
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .	151.30200892146868
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	9991217.543770982
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	10173139.555964995
i will only add , god bless you .	7.597510984699419
fitzwilliam darcy.	1
chapter xiii.	1
if elizabeth , when mr. darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .	9517.371248385703
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .	1612.482805806872
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .	13.932675655340136
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .	228228.46398171157
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .	476.1204961595436
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .	153450.7594481402
his belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .	155965.0050031079
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .	503.4725048438824
it was all pride and insolence .	3.261671730179271
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .	906822258.9656162
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .	13.335403467416192
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , this must be false !	51.86542234072513
this cannot be !	1.4165374209268438
this must be the grossest falsehood !	3.279971734830379
-- and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .	274220.57259848464
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .	977526952.5979075
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .	143494.35350344508
so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will , the difference was great .	269.70191756844804
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .	9971135.013148787
but when she read , and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	1945660.2882771236
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality -- deliberated on the probability of each statement -- but with little success .	5766.321106498878
on both sides it was only assertion .	4.281508267780541
again she read on .	2.0309374756054037
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr. darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole .	5350292.074011617
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr. wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .	27258.891889706272
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the ---- shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .	236992.03384702816
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself .	228.95478976499402
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	213.10400146300123
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	334.4199166026075
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .	902474211.9382735
but no such recollection befriended her .	3.744263788647282
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .	618421.5728719276
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .	81.83142112573826
but , alas !	1.3400883533278956
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself -- from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	6614034276.857815
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .	10135250.408818526
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr. philips's .	748.1383020150364
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .	14.740714483202767
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .	398.25966198979125
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .	405.2915082236919
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy -- that mr. darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week .	127008.66936179773
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr. darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .	3446138463.941937
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !	19.019163763262984
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .	144814.29675110866
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .	235936.85797023054
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of mr. darcy , she could not but allow that mr. bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust -- any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .	122163051726510.06
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued -- that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .	750921.2463842349
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr. bingley , was incomprehensible .	1287854.6623211475
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself .	4.0956681799948225
-- of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .	779.6076201763815
how despicably have i acted !	2.841607343824731
she cried .	1
-- i , who have prided myself on my discernment !	11.166561267158045
-- i , who have valued myself on my abilities !	11.16858553619433
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust .	548.75654386303
-- how humiliating is this discovery !	4.021290895100805
-- yet , how just a humiliation !	5.702197518944936
-- had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind .	34.70615386852451
but vanity , not love , has been my folly .	12.232405141727284
-- pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .	191708.2778489002
till this moment , i never knew myself .	5.5934649523957285
from herself to jane -- from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again .	82315.63777830172
widely different was the effect of a second perusal .	10.748335889352022
-- how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?	1424.9065177482476
-- he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment ; -- and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been .	1585.0220395032316
-- neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane .	27.52241109913007
-- she felt that jane's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .	18120.832317161272
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .	8784.18538696946
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .	4273103.4876777865
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .	11.649326109984106
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family ; -- and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .	1115168873.7364023
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re-considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .	277709075303.5389
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr. darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found .	53123700.42303555
-- elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .	133.44451109417437
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object .	4.453333196727999
she could think only of her letter .	4.438519464289424
chapter xiv.	1
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and mr. collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings .	288341353.87821937
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .	6741327.483128662
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .	794790.7199784218
what would she have said ?	2.614242981619278
-- how would she have behaved ?	3.6921052170328363
were questions with which she amused herself .	5.29378726370078
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party .	14.761952871696288
-- i assure you , i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine ; i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do .	1362.596961475979
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me !	163.4275940689104
-- they were excessively sorry to go !	5.731231138640179
but so they always are .	2.8724695492560555
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year .	5247.279134455638
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases .	4.421467375105646
mr. collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .	1078.7897197010227
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added ,	43777.6759924455
but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .	398.15305886108723
mrs. collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure .	37.10747243246946
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth , but it is not in my power to accept it .	688.5132951936986
-- i must be in town next saturday .	5.462986327463927
why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .	47.95503504860766
i expected you to stay two months .	4.956642337094107
i told mrs. collins so before you came .	7.705985362875982
there can be no occasion for your going so soon .	11.605597925240525
mrs. bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight .	10.057951673421917
but my father cannot .	1.8612702427235954
-- he wrote last week to hurry my return .	11.633664449982021
oh !	1
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can .	30.489598602577228
-- daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .	21.679118954150788
and if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large .	58306628764.71373
you are all kindness , madam ; but i believe we must abide by our original plan .	118.12148944952509
lady catherine seemed resigned .	1.764481070085981
mrs. collins , you must send a servant with them .	7.953207970816072
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .	408.80445075481646
it is highly improper .	2.02834278005359
you must contrive to send somebody .	4.102509985594878
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing .	30.367252622606085
-- young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .	117.32530512190131
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her .	1159.1480177552241
-- miss darcy , the daughter of mr. darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner .	1262.686991683818
-- i am excessively attentive to all those things .	9.243103652032595
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs. collins .	18.12304515190911
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone .	953.3382822764191
my uncle is to send a servant for us .	9.90273146526417
oh !	1
-- your uncle !	1.4167282870233944
-- he keeps a man-servant , does he ?	8.223924648576183
-- i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	35.369669901772774
where shall you change horses ?	2.834694572100612
-- oh !	1
bromley , of course .	2.039698569918574
-- if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to .	50.324489307880384
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .	4061777.71849729
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .	1668425.2248735179
mr. darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .	40.28797059909704
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .	79.29100212247099
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .	699413.4661217204
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .	83175.7834522091
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	7372.3401287481665
they were hopeless of remedy .	2.8979588827118117
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .	305955.29835441307
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?	36712.83245088353
catherine , weak-spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self-willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .	27591.770263109385
they were ignorant , idle , and vain .	6.67186211868238
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever .	6709.455942089342
anxiety on jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr. darcy's explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost .	21683.99087032534
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .	10233.516564287102
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !	386420.01857688
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .	1446250.888647948
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	344.92506045902985
the very last evening was spent there ; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .	3145149853.7361207
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .	795800.4503797644
chapter xv.	1
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .	14854.212674062423
i know not , miss elizabeth said he , whether mrs. collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .	189982.24917625086
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .	33.23637621904824
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .	66.4628421298874
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .	177477250.27545914
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .	16.696078839089207
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .	6889.10670247831
mr. collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied ,	16.765013537701396
it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .	65.47807165667435
we have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .	41025313.702729166
our situation with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	492.5502639646635
you see on what a footing we are .	8.165968999615389
you see how continually we are engaged there .	8.13861723225176
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings .	180481.61484676244
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .	12693.274788982948
you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin .	167.02171688811433
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .	15.162808328156634
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs. collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent .	367593.77192547155
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	970.2773828473721
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .	39.29284184470737
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .	86.94157583793077
we seem to have been designed for each other .	7.955686487562325
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .	13121.76000167041
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	671.6859761035729
poor charlotte !	1
-- it was melancholy to leave her to such society !	10.722740529166284
-- but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .	3331.5027465540297
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .	1321.9327942510893
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .	1413.7602277570998
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr. collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner , though unknown .	167184444.33930954
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings .	339624.2124237602
but he added , you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here .	11233.298121468286
elizabeth made no objection ; -- the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .	188.96752932455124
good gracious !	1
cried maria , after a few minutes silence , it seems but a day or two since we first came !	182.28521374917352
-- and yet how many things have happened !	7.3768491225817865
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh .	14.380639644341423
we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice !	36.14547200440447
-- how much i shall have to tell !	5.723539215879452
elizabeth privately added , and how much i shall have to conceal .	26.26251936548132
their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr. gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .	32032.98505910549
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .	3876.920556307384
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .	140.27233993221944
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr. darcy's proposals .	713.1179656085518
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .	8352248435352.651
chapter xvi.	1
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch-street , for the town of ---- in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .	1530948776.572394
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .	22347.742756866057
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , is not this nice ?	9489.409633586241
is not this an agreeable surprise ?	3.6917679215346646
and we mean to treat you all added lydia ; but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there .	6751.920862154832
then shewing her purchases look here , i have bought this bonnet .	19.87391691116458
i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not .	117.53158473848792
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better .	759.9668773229191
and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , oh !	99.7652622077227
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable .	8573.820605554547
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ---- shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight .	1525.04259686187
are they indeed ?	1.4170931726001113
cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .	3.3925779004246652
they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !	619.3222873410808
it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	100.03641273367988
mamma would like to go too of all things !	8.99105812304321
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have !	12.469934565949558
yes thought elizabeth , that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .	197.9866270713664
good heaven !	1
brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton .	6302.930944920289
now i have got some news for you said lydia , as they sat down to table .	79.10197926178022
what do you think ?	1.5886258523309431
it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like .	146.05527376615547
jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .	89.98887858660096
lydia laughed , and said ,	2.914745864312531
aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .	13.089156412960321
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !	22.544810754224642
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say .	62.040195191317075
but he is an ugly fellow !	3.21228952260785
i am glad he is gone .	3.4945047454546945
i never saw such a long chin in my life .	14.787859868704256
well , but now for my news it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?	735.8886528697808
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king .	8.94297798879084
there's for you !	1.4163091621663049
she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool ; gone to stay .	37.427474839240034
wickham is safe .	1.4342423957666421
and mary king is safe !	2.83956726699027
added elizabeth ; safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune .	22.159333790311507
she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him .	26.01069674333661
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane .	22.395478843503042
i am sure there is not on his .	4.728520066186362
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .	33.05391764789546
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ?	11.422850505711796
elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !	60600.58407812999
as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases , were seated in it .	3899967.731931288
how nicely we are crammed in !	4.039066060507479
cried lydia .	1
i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !	149.43939285903454
well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .	311.72387622469006
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .	163.98685185930032
have you seen any pleasant men ?	4.015218899353915
have you had any flirting ?	2.837932646812561
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .	121.96501779146838
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare .	18.827929530033664
she is almost three and twenty !	4.106144502237357
lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty !	63.562585597518485
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .	39.58654768260715
she says lizzy had better have taken mr. collins ; but i do not think there would have been any fun in it .	414.00125942155614
lord !	1
how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls .	471.3104079666418
dear me !	1
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster's .	43.770564698625854
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , mrs. forster and me are such friends !	19203.4142218708
) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?	25712.46698215814
we dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , -- only think what fun !	487.32648520575657
not a soul knew of it , but col .	8.964013143745458
and mrs. forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked !	10458.362061922895
when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .	1538.675980988876
lord !	1
how i laughed !	1.4169637805717217
and so did mrs. forster .	2.866973371160974
i thought i should have died .	2.9981827095792113
and that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter .	159.5590534555469
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn .	19632.25264588799
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name .	163.3522470904067
their reception at home was most kind .	5.762098951506236
mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth ,	1031.509498124363
i am glad you are come back , lizzy .	7.538145659963095
their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; mrs. bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .	4678315950606723.0
oh !	1
mary said she , i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !	68.46810847993034
as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	100640623759.19101
and then when we came away it was such fun !	11.947910894867555
i thought we never should have got into the coach .	15.030250909797479
i was ready to die of laughter .	4.920736964182748
and then we were so merry all the way home !	12.171007466311274
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off !	157.24545333284146
to this , mary very gravely replied , far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .	422.7070534445446
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .	21.55299806235338
but i confess they would have no charms for me .	13.816503002723405
i should infinitely prefer a book .	4.0750146999201995
but of this answer lydia heard not a word .	9.8448461879684
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all .	206.99050394393208
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .	5455.997026659177
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .	688.0650725775486
there was another reason too for her opposition .	7.5339051058857995
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .	72.21173226696047
the comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .	55.03630570589345
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	1587.9530496291325
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .	32668.41501701751
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .	209825.88727072664
chapter xvii.	1
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr. darcy and herself .	7291278.86135279
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .	13101.204642991808
she was sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .	132417.66271225776
his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong said she ; and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment .	10650.812004021427
indeed replied elizabeth , i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .	1247.5759833456373
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ?	11.230794861970653
blame you !	1
oh , no .	1.350035604397284
but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham .	17.03110393502139
no -- i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did .	40.700929493718476
but you will know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day .	71.33200672117185
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .	198.5643809457226
what a stroke was this for poor jane !	8.09368437663526
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .	6777.806968251014
nor was darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .	154.75319362809213
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	731.6246136762221
this will not do said elizabeth .	3.421846926252165
you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .	39.63988825508638
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .	16.012526130481582
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .	9802.144396934382
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr. darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse .	230.45565667261903
it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane .	51.998391451837534
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she .	13.435359173015163
wickham so very bad !	2.0040704932453433
it is almost past belief .	2.868830402511988
and poor mr. darcy !	2.0039289012505974
dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .	10.281353876692513
such a disappointment !	1.416962949712793
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	8.87389101459944
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !	11.247647919296345
it is really too distressing .	2.494237939491808
i am sure you must feel it so .	5.450926075192587
oh !	1
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	150.583200224437
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .	337.456454530586
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather .	1312.643519480641
poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !	28.10504881521224
such an openness and gentleness in his manner .	7.459985428688937
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .	61.24831669746614
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it .	49.83934947992363
i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do .	110.26142645943585
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .	252.9920435329104
it is such a spur to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .	430.9157043427312
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty .	6490.07713648618
lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now .	398.83739890322255
indeed i could not .	1.6900374647854854
i was uncomfortable enough .	2.024968939355116
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy .	7.465520620662632
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had !	61686.07962938518
oh !	1
how i wanted you !	2.009408405749034
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved .	2244.335084968331
certainly .	1
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging .	360.0649510055303
there is one point , on which i want your advice .	16.444710024978622
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character .	322.8088214359203
miss bennet paused a little and then replied , surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	382.7847054313875
what is your own opinion ?	2.3882634683945994
that it ought not to be attempted .	4.272538359272338
mr. darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .	18.94606003487441
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	114478.91471945091
the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	15204.111015750279
i am not equal to it .	2.582340753110508
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	313.4863085948964
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .	569.5066832421918
at present i will say nothing about it .	7.181426431390493
you are quite right .	1.7615333323082687
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .	21.166458251078602
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character .	119.49800662541939
we must not make him desperate .	3.069669820051189
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation .	13.761490553768963
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .	91942.53090540021
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .	38.9440604501934
she dared not relate the other half of mr. darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .	1307.1864017286769
here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .	46812.24032133628
and then said she , if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .	16426.780178468493
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value !	54.47898073121657
she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .	357.2049723958375
jane was not happy .	2.0287940975751244
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .	11.587537719952874
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .	1191983711214.4824
well , lizzy said mrs. bennet one day , what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane's ?	168.74036151723087
for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .	47.61946179235756
i told my sister philips so the other day .	8.96709160437076
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london .	27.332615585363765
well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .	3067.5450375207342
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know .	1342.4617602651488
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more .	28.05377141584607
oh , well !	1.4167286501497394
it is just as he chooses .	3.2698886213642218
nobody wants him to come .	2.493226634245514
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .	1532.1756216026263
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done .	2943.4254565725346
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	89.4018185434375
well , lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards , and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ?	246.01791750361875
well , well , i only hope it will last .	9.461052367376748
and what sort of table do they keep ?	6.122273068492382
charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .	7.428747148096285
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .	37.83885218181766
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say .	11.80616684482886
no , nothing at all .	2.778117630127131
a great deal of good management , depend upon it .	11.828874294008882
yes , yes .	1.3435852324133846
they will take care not to outrun their income .	10.170093796988743
they will never be distressed for money .	5.0220807583903335
well , much good may it do them !	8.079423788262112
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .	74.16287241725495
they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens .	62.633141560838155
it was a subject which they could not mention before me .	13.479032257701226
no .	1
it would have been strange if they had .	5.652211921771982
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .	32.647722091546036
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .	359.5848852121098
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me .	27.535616638608733
chapter xviii.	1
the first week of their return was soon gone .	11.666903955777311
the second began .	1.4342398545512978
it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .	301.1049848444934
the dejection was almost universal .	2.869481094710043
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .	1233.5243680295255
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family .	12343.227894987227
good heaven !	1
what is to become of us !	3.348032355221486
what are we to do !	2.866149240495361
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .	11.779990221655702
how can you be smiling so , lizzy ?	6.455617653391079
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .	1699.2537342657647
i am sure said she , i cried for two days together when colonel millar's regiment went away .	145.31019203018022
i thought i should have broke my heart .	6.003195597812229
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia .	9.423085482400786
if one could but go to brighton !	4.63469159107921
observed mrs. bennet .	1.4299421036894884
oh , yes !	1.3219882805632093
-- if one could but go to brighton !	6.561439036370594
but papa is so disagreeable .	2.874559912254795
a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever .	10.720403625147505
and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty .	106.60469062817847
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn-house .	12.120527001098345
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	133.25351371453704
she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	6131.445147574602
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton .	41013.64827877305
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .	24.261722234019174
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two .	4540.577092192785
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs. forster , the delight of mrs. bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described .	8758.624771798659
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .	40284067.47367539
i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she , though i am not her particular friend .	700.7019834706236
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older .	634.4633738217898
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .	65.5178105611725
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	787488704.5824538
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .	15195010.10096722
he heard her attentively , and then said ,	5.938398536149061
lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances .	190329.0299882533
if you were aware said elizabeth , of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair .	2564119.0608863505
already arisen !	1
repeated mr. bennet .	1.431035889654155
what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?	16.28706935205943
poor little lizzy !	1.4169591300646398
but do not be cast down .	3.2532746443591574
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .	247.03951559446244
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly .	269.54938964973167
indeed you are mistaken .	2.022463579443835
i have no such injuries to resent .	4.503598241099345
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining .	82.36788808165774
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia's character .	4997.718318346285
excuse me -- for i must speak plainly .	6.534650551153862
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .	203182.016419961
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	2145.141803459172
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .	14636095.366217712
in this danger kitty is also comprehended .	5.750693393814436
she will follow wherever lydia leads .	4.059016486153842
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !	9.322020390943475
oh !	1
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ?	14550.248186681018
mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply ,	281.1251083838321
do not make yourself uneasy , my love .	6.792089688540421
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or i may say , three very silly sisters .	56382.442807967185
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .	51.715735258714126
let her go then .	1.7669093352921434
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	8193.60110155106
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .	160.59094370352813
the officers will find women better worth their notice .	11.502444257093233
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	78.87348726808426
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life .	896.9243455431963
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	1101.6041178724906
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	157.56208016485206
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .	4355.132575485528
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .	2471.647601688549
in lydia's imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .	62.25862956248619
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .	392.35041390712763
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .	189.89203537489368
she saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once .	48620375.68453064
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	2031.9665436419489
they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .	95.46253967582082
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .	591.2248072083593
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home .	1493.5807942872116
elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time .	14.85585900789102
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so .	1513.2725430591074
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	3302.2122869360223
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .	4569088.800942779
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .	2698496715.037342
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr. darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	14475873258.873283
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man , asked her how she had liked him .	1056441.7673544877
her answer was warmly in his favour .	4.98414379138384
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , how long did you say that he was at rosings ?	194.9329208326642
nearly three weeks .	1.4330139241201891
and you saw him frequently ?	2.620217439036325
yes , almost every day .	2.4610810383216495
his manners are very different from his cousin's .	6.3886878196880295
yes , very different .	1.7643578144513392
but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance .	8.161177338534031
indeed !	1
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her .	11.831686185996137
and pray may i ask ?	2.886329749643882
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , is it in address that he improves ?	197.82532194766128
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?	33.26862466808753
for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone , that he is improved in essentials .	394.3239024129474
oh , no !	1.3032495138495501
said elizabeth .	1
in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was .	47.16728406948395
while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .	511.2325264052913
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added ,	490.15157760986915
when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood .	107157.86168050923
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents ,	186574.69009257323
you , who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .	24656.315033473486
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .	25474.195622395135
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .	328032.45383631
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart .	551292.2144076339
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	246.1991208084784
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .	1775.0314987827849
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .	620409.8774851224
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .	1556.5526976425635
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .	26.11498169458821
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .	118.32267561014574
mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	4285635554.2448487
chapter xix.	1
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	2252.788515786074
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .	2174649.8555541057
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .	653.1434422504902
but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .	210274.01448621534
he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .	257.02628361690984
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .	405.58353690925503
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .	246297.0287018698
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .	132.16208540186005
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	351837966.78225267
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .	2910917061.118952
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .	480.85546550532376
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	199974796553810.03
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .	330636.1181435262
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .	9190275.217489343
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .	11710495.4248588
but it is fortunate thought she , that i have something to wish for .	21.24208135109438
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .	23.461822200442644
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .	7856.128395658821
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation .	9220.940261042724
when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .	17389.254488283867
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; -- and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .	1.9060283701644132e+16
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn .	751.063441303847
everything wore a happier aspect .	2.868646929560047
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .	304.86820682329034
mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton .	226531833539.05142
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .	310577.1039736108
mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire .	14946709568562.303
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	4112.030784774208
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak .	2653014.123023614
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough .	1350.7243000768633
but it was her business to be satisfied -- and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .	728.1331637697122
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .	13.365894506127846
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .	58.84726187849495
but surely said she , i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me .	1785.130438112184
the period of expectation was now doubled .	5.014015743688356
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .	24.05975929705002
but they did pass away , and mr. and mrs. gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn .	807.951050795839
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way -- teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .	868885532.9765197
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	809.3962724103689
one enjoyment was certain -- that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences -- cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure -- and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .	1684987.999977599
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c .	164835.60372357353
are sufficiently known .	1.4342401933990527
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern .	14.002592749489976
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs. gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated .	179208059.75726002
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .	165.21557294735922
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .	262.9591580102181
mr. gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .	51.00862148174214
my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ?	165.28657231457257
said her aunt .	1.2723223758216928
a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .	40.25171488700823
wickham passed all his youth there , you know .	11.650726072226215
elizabeth was distressed .	1.431037112236665
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .	147.91323718185168
she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .	5251.5811009818535
mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity .	2.886767996014031
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she , i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .	919.4983546614667
they have some of the finest woods in the country .	12.76952893612527
elizabeth said no more -- but her mind could not acquiesce .	18.01838410796514
the possibility of meeting mr. darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .	30.68898275379459
it would be dreadful !	1.4722741144835059
she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	2243.7125240082337
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	20456.664203806613
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .	468799.5826495146
a most welcome negative followed the last question -- and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	941852530.9529893
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go .	5.949131882055998

chapter i.	1
elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	60573.38189670873
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .	33.720069979606095
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .	2071.1644052461506
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .	384.35926933024655
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .	12098139.28207583
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; -- and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .	3226360.970710129
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .	11.689117733211702
elizabeth was delighted .	1.4321558759958382
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	2831.9418460578013
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !	1573.6942829955015
they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .	25206.647796335645
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	7.033519257110444
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .	15751.145927877196
the housekeeper came ; a respectable-looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .	2681.229056712215
they followed her into the dining-parlour .	3.5584359104445347
it was a large , well-proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	18.364062525774067
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .	76.65624305966635
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	1394.4592993094584
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	327117.7060279975
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .	1833.3457031787416
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .	10790180.34977178
and of this place thought she , i might have been mistress !	13.524779915677907
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted !	14.795115702598192
instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .	2666.763067504102
-- but no -- recollecting herself , -- that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them .	4597.959346532053
this was a lucky recollection -- it saved her from something like regret .	43.51337684013961
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .	421.1282385578974
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs. reynolds replied , that he was , adding , but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends .	242721.6604099106
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	185.45309570581455
her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	14.246964243705383
she approached , and saw the likeness of mr. wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle-piece .	345.2172842417838
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .	20.260433399877982
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence .	44212.86009894746
-- he is now gone into the army she added , but i am afraid he has turned out very wild .	256.87756878140425
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it .	54.747653302754735
and that said mrs. reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , is my master -- and very like him .	731.916207967054
it was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago .	53.717214223661436
i have heard much of your master's fine person said mrs. gardiner , looking at the picture ; it is a handsome face .	445.7746461477176
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not .	43.969671806700106
mrs. reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .	135.57074381237717
does that young lady know mr. darcy ?	5.218005142798897
elizabeth coloured , and said -- a little .	5.9046927010573045
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ?	17.494771813745274
yes , very handsome .	1.7655735909677666
i am sure i know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .	3594.8206391618082
this room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .	311.9485632657172
he was very fond of them .	2.746778576180968
this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham's being among them .	16.380269327521972
mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .	261.0952859770549
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ?	8.92892921468783
said mr. gardiner .	1.431935369001369
oh !	1
yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished !	46.62316964426321
-- she plays and sings all day long .	8.201194803295571
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master ; she comes here to-morrow with him .	3687.9335120440696
mr. gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; mrs. reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	206080.2715861657
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ?	21.473435859574415
not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months .	9440.232768301941
except thought elizabeth , when she goes to ramsgate .	7.731147104333752
if your master would marry , you might see more of him .	30.892551273429692
yes , sir ; but i do not know when that will be .	23.751936389511325
i do not know who is good enough for him .	10.213820050888646
mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled .	2.133085142787445
elizabeth could not help saying , it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so .	503.9795559305897
i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him replied the other .	206.58261860366434
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old .	371509.1194008528
this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .	85.28707207586211
that he was not a good-tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	17.621901593062905
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying ,	177.40933959348467
there are very few people of whom so much can be said .	23.74252414250395
you are lucky in having such a master .	8.225772473384927
yes , sir , i know i am .	4.525454172298079
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better .	47.94739891311906
but i have always observed , that they who are good-natured when children , are good-natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest-tempered , most generous-hearted , boy in the world .	24987.97915110991
elizabeth almost stared at her .	2.8920693413048597
-- can this be mr. darcy !	3.698841995002428
thought she .	1
his father was an excellent man said mrs. gardiner .	9.054198264330488
yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor .	866.9420200655892
elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .	21.95125874058511
mrs. reynolds could interest her on no other point .	11.607200936016186
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .	776.0509733662112
mr. gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .	1728464.9223578025
he is the best landlord , and the best master said she , that ever lived .	64.68238223933184
not like the wild young men now-a-days , who think of nothing but themselves .	53.438753387538775
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .	95.15861244484422
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it .	60.26383027620369
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men .	78.06638274428141
in what an amiable light does this place him !	10.455082658464391
thought elizabeth .	1
this fine account of him whispered her aunt , as they walked , is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend .	693.9173872363154
perhaps we might be deceived .	2.8743227115622028
that is not very likely ; our authority was too good .	19.167693816020837
on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley .	49907231.70144251
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .	62.75304252442109
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .	33.10623442171558
and this is always the way with him she added .	12.46048045708662
-- whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .	131.81663341608746
there is nothing he would not do for her .	6.625817528273649
the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed-rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .	293.7494964433506
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	11287672.687700545
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .	417.1169821033197
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	97.82593015118314
at last it arrested her -- and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .	38834.56750475554
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	689.5409497767843
mrs. reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .	38.5819430523952
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .	10113.907760405127
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds was of no trifling nature .	47.03923870616996
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?	32.83101092788211
as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship !	363.90629131272874
-- how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow !	41.318330110973015
-- how much of good or evil must be done by him !	21.06619686121219
every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .	767664617.1491871
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .	340788.8759693556
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .	37369069.37904455
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	1004.1293474104122
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .	84.434094209805
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .	225324.24805312965
she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .	1113.8749957281298
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr. darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .	2596152.062388845
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .	387609.8166304844
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .	44645029.764910385
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	147142990.93106344
at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .	3153.0108967465007
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .	16129.367980948866
she was overpowered by shame and vexation .	5.370554978841246
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill-judged thing in the world !	50.237008491024824
how strange must it appear to him !	5.767227433304784
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !	37.994981142036096
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !	38.29515890518706
oh !	1
why did she come ?	2.004807522045172
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	35.707898677242696
had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .	100235.0527540366
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	17.117411000264447
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , -- what could it mean ?	47.351625353101866
that he should even speak to her was amazing !	8.019711324429707
-- but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !	29.29551516438449
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	2851.520161258665
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park , when he put his letter into her hand !	771.1426014048043
she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .	31.168336588734824
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	1137319124157.935
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .	761.769181217774
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	21633.701859062534
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .	3363.575093838338
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .	3070.69716928014
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .	2124.217496232595
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .	1310854079.2981184
mr. gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .	364.3522991619521
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .	46.469211858620035
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	188619.2861373756
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .	101445572.61811058
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .	2237512.9228148195
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	122273882149.97772
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .	67126.1851517023
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .	371.4960171039685
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	16677.83240709887
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .	91.4653004238348
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .	1562.265470820125
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .	744475943.7425238
her colour changed , and she said no more .	8.080745204454146
mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .	3955.822747412681
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .	1162594.3032674238
what will be his surprise thought she , when he knows who they are !	35.62615078605073
he takes them now for people of fashion .	8.238613150988778
the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	2296677.7142646234
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr. gardiner .	35901.16746923791
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	14.332923658100935
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .	219.97293295079197
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .	44381.1965154025
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr. darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .	149285150.34917387
mrs. gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .	333.9790188300538
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .	124.46125795861153
her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , why is he so altered ?	241.16501481210364
from what can it proceed ?	2.844994212217625
it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .	125.69029945833283
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .	30.371196240066958
it is impossible that he should still love me .	8.009717717876098
after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	2170595.9809299666
it originated in mrs. gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .	6735.708247779806
mr. darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	31.923652594102563
after a short silence , the lady first spoke .	10.252498900828002
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected -- for your housekeeper she added , informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country .	1719058010.226717
he acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .	26529.92126436061
they will join me early to-morrow he continued , and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , -- mr. bingley and his sisters .	3942.9572439049316
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .	4.336693291212628
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr. bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .	32566.832727419023
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause , who more particularly wishes to be known to you , -- will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ?	6134754.025808826
the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	1094.518146714199
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .	1495022.634367871
they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .	27.228141306804083
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .	58.55610870998348
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .	54.4877297538739
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .	1186.9893761543829
he then asked her to walk into the house -- but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .	915.9349316378147
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .	71.40605079474135
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .	26.23193447087706
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .	307.0818611681451
yet time and her aunt moved slowly -- and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over .	1230.1198347868144
on mr. and mrs. gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .	38903.67517690842
mr. darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .	973.5949048936216
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .	1390.6038927442216
he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming said her uncle .	45.21761713814224
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt , but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming .	1474.7206871553387
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it .	775.578631500628
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .	15.836429334788072
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .	130.53386887139658
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling .	5.3029607182301515
to be sure , lizzy said her aunt , he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .	7141.296659703592
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ?	23.40748539981358
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	16352.890111287523
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle .	53.456224635456266
your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds .	24073.6360443438
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .	26.078454765337614
from what we have seen of him continued mrs. gardiner , i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham .	66957.56032753018
he has not an ill-natured look .	3.5485448085044404
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	30.11293854012776
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .	339.8917030252985
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !	394.6197052940347
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .	4.827209766849709
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue .	254.31018185769472
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire .	12595563963.433039
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	51775.594068107326
mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	16526515.15671085
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance .	312583.7502388263
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr. darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .	8005865.079530729
chapter ii.	1
elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .	136686.6362646936
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came .	467.1988467414037
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	36495755.04734802
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	24560.99925934969
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .	345540.8089930059
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .	46412.794481336496
while these newly-born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .	346.710836452391
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	16729849.959635468
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .	271601.9403621012
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	40.30897386221046
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .	174.6218142220087
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	7080.099777944936
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	66.88383101914448
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .	10791.701625226324
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .	1565.3773543581322
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .	8105.678395423236
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	10665322.112686232
all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .	189029.43312052256
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done .	2940.574842774948
to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .	62.07015754117413
they had long wished to see him .	4.9578149912169565
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .	17.984499194355003
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr. darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	3483502.0874782
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .	874.7682273326005
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .	11.255389663201134
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	61169200.10972335
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased .	58.96276925015171
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh !	36.75382135053676
how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .	189.53519723688314
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .	39392.86430394417
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane .	7218.4749559227375
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .	12.934264042749252
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .	28.21063689781458
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	10329819.932280527
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and , before she could reply , he added , it is above eight months .	10817316.684346119
we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield .	183.66870289151757
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at longbourn .	33436.76356108244
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .	1345.2552375652917
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .	46780191286.462906
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .	2502642185534.2666
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .	119224571793.32489
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country .	2113774.84780497
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	208.89795187151208
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .	15822.901918379908
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .	19534816.753682364
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends .	11346.060576113226
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	148830191.91162357
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .	53620.47984949638
but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .	290.34550966301737
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .	3263.79279579135
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .	17.16836305831854
of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .	1509.1388301081806
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr. darcy .	2620828.0091410656
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .	1273641.745130753
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .	253.53201494638037
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town , where the family did not visit .	99796.76381074161
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .	198.09655957045504
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged .	145450477.01946324
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .	8790803.31092817
she certainly did not hate him .	4.076711634405317
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .	4959.789460568572
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .	1128337591.1199534
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .	776.0169724136364
it was gratitude .	1.4342423957666421
-- gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .	367135.88585489395
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .	1828845142.2186017
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude -- for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .	38588598.347680025
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .	2302447737.380209
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .	240441233912.25528
they were , therefore , to go .	3.8403281562301546
-- elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .	391.67872315022413
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast .	4.590951535351937
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon .	2154.5122698431883
chapter iii.	1
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .	17545559.56269718
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	687.0482270055555
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .	64935.05431090809
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london .	4720.150455134815
georgiana's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .	1635671.5317587405
mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .	52.47144242476779
by mrs. hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	34630.88430919308
it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	45624131.209983125
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	11110.211981007717
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .	3841.0942133627645
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .	87418.93654221563
her own thoughts were employing her .	4.089497813840632
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	35.06393231750783
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .	4334.403645464453
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .	19578.36771574001
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .	43.06002847925493
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .	134518566.11145905
there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	151042.92483171314
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	51365677.55526322
he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .	569234.1694854189
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; -- a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .	2446340736.2513285
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .	5411003.166529394
miss darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .	805122.9575812626
miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility ,	1267.1274622150788
pray , miss eliza , are not the ---- shire militia removed from meryton ?	31.64239585909937
they must be a great loss to your family .	7.311597600513559
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .	29647534.32510247
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .	21400.973571740178
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .	256374533112.72144
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement .	30.377529313529692
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .	4549143.758071081
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .	320568.6348518879
elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .	212404.4931286032
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .	541151.283774337
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .	231651.34804921024
but georgiana would not join her .	4.091058214829748
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .	142162.92067248267
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .	1346.6857305791452
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy she cried ; i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .	8699.62700442669
she is grown so brown and coarse !	5.725328949274008
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again .	25.486411200655613
however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , -- no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	230328.32823784894
for my own part she rejoined , i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .	228.26829309820172
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .	349.29445969066387
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .	23.889019176300284
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .	31477.44586141185
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .	6341.200645635759
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .	487543.8711549022
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued ,	131.14961938193545
i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' she a beauty !	582054.5735557991
-- i should as soon call her mother a wit .'	16.230952845394246
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time .	289.0108346159235
yes replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance .	65438.95967007821
he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .	1931.3322376903743
mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .	2488.4657967017956
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .	935.9445074758196
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him , and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .	1017478.8681553018
chapter iv.	1
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .	16501543406.097923
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill .	56.48225585184916
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .	8548.19198502124
the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago .	102.334303337408
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .	578534.9392668706
it was to this effect	1.6236941513991476
since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well .	22451.27579221661
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .	9.412325918588573
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham !	648120.9277531598
-- imagine our surprise .	2.0286900872843563
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	13.975424547231315
i am very , very sorry .	3.1213178547804303
so imprudent a match on both sides !	4.58770628459405
-- but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .	73.38965859039467
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .	2317.250906502783
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .	125.65697630423254
our poor mother is sadly grieved .	3.726713919217497
my father bears it better .	2.8811920077603563
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .	1106.1598082933676
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	772.942502197691
the express was sent off directly .	3.3476006314308435
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .	24.797348520798003
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .	15.196402508443843
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .	44.8374533009683
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother .	29.176849289496616
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written .	116.57492519640955
without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .	3010933.933358486
by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent .	342656.9220253728
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .	425.1490079459432
imprudent as a marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland .	266276.9187451298
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	213.74972650809747
though lydia's short letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w. never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b. intending to trace their route .	292654463.6835189
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom .	21498.800321687762
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road .	79.47248087138396
i know not what to think .	3.3654372984331173
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f. came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .	4596308.679311016
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .	1494.5988537001906
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f. but no one can throw any blame on them .	165.93984708064045
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great .	8.62501620166317
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him .	40.71120728786779
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ?	7275891.889675415
-- impossible .	1
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w. was not a man to be trusted .	195958.32413481057
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .	13.906707362607605
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected .	3603.882339309178
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .	252.86428432887195
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ?	66341.30609538512
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .	41.98780867129785
adieu .	1
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .	72310.98825433894
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former .	4140.331098585314
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her .	106.46906577195611
what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening .	403204.5412471691
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness .	11423.36720320484
oh !	1
where , where is my uncle ?	4.0210662157177115
cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr. darcy appeared .	1112775.0941761523
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , i beg your pardon , but i must leave you .	1462046.830132135
i must find mr. gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose .	691.5153092282009
good god !	1
what is the matter ?	1.84261473264045
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr. and mrs. gardiner .	37871.10683412678
you are not well enough ; -- you cannot go yourself .	14.732466454924493
elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .	1033.8588499960715
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .	17479.864986414952
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , let me call your maid .	2018579.4455367788
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ?	25.31228984161141
-- a glass of wine ; -- shall i get you one ?	32.87733302047539
-- you are very ill .	2.109137902205001
no , i thank you she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .	16.501698607585052
there is nothing the matter with me .	4.213995680351303
i am quite well .	1.706944061603425
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn .	64.52340718176137
she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .	287.50498500814786
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .	477.3979904772101
at length , she spoke again .	2.7241923085660518
i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .	22.89734230217558
it cannot be concealed from any one .	4.582957500122729
my youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; -- has thrown herself into the power of -- of mr. wickham .	1540.1398141819798
they are gone off together from brighton .	5.2794353188962795
you know him too well to doubt the rest .	9.305770702381494
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever .	376.58215856602015
darcy was fixed in astonishment .	2.8865053098499236
when i consider she added , in a yet more agitated voice , that i might have prevented it !	146.4935409358324
-- i who knew what he was .	4.696371935425727
had i but explained some part of it only -- some part of what i learnt , to my own family !	357.8207057688562
had his character been known , this could not have happened .	14.914036125115354
but it is all , all too late now .	7.371313105088955
i am grieved , indeed cried darcy ; grieved -- shocked .	21.652277841896012
but is it certain , absolutely certain ?	5.774646936826586
oh yes !	1
-- they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland .	2059.1940383624396
and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ?	39.215771732395126
my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour .	6189.578979810757
but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done .	68.70482155904858
how is such a man to be worked on ?	8.262837681116398
how are they even to be discovered ?	5.287918681120085
i have not the smallest hope .	3.155985046993618
it is every way horrible !	2.835143957939787
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .	4.934235055570657
when my eyes were opened to his real character .	10.212367830677753
-- oh !	1
had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do !	36.27654102655479
but i knew not -- i was afraid of doing too much .	23.917485215397992
wretched , wretched , mistake !	2.8855357162376625
darcy made no answer .	1.917588606027016
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy .	1671.8886609935696
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	7.669341988144367
her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .	1316.9035545091408
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .	2897.875334577859
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .	98737.78160408947
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	20.6584699168278
lydia -- the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .	2025447159645179.0
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress .	1020.2524887470133
-- but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	341.5294055468844
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day .	339.37073412466304
oh , yes .	1.1944972495415096
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy .	16.09890917179946
say that urgent business calls us home immediately .	8.124247135567623
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible .	13.144444928086575
-- i know it cannot be long .	3.987420900984458
he readily assured her of his secrecy -- again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	8802451.36703126
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .	24882985057.23685
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .	498.53720692295667
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .	1229821587573.1167
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .	45205.97615096361
never , since reading jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her .	305.42437936888604
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .	43.823150768495296
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .	10.054186812771096
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise -- all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	2117138.835725789
but now it was all too natural .	4.612719221679629
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .	12898567.70411453
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .	28102.49499677837
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .	293.70573003851484
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .	33.11381491792914
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl .	23.266289492669888
-- oh !	1
how acutely did she now feel it .	5.779270728879677
she was wild to be at home -- to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .	2659191785385.0054
mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; -- but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy .	176044122.39510053
-- though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be deeply affected .	280.08535272624596
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr. gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power .	8027.144019735341
-- elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .	25626.526429113976
they were to be off as soon as possible .	5.440654248730382
but what is to be done about pemberley ?	6.423121567721783
cried mrs. gardiner .	1.3424938700402673
john told us mr. darcy was here when you sent for us ; -- was it so ?	147.54166970055655
yes ; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .	33.35300395490882
that is all settled .	1.9150501598304737
that is all settled repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .	62.13823191591379
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !	49.42797779615452
oh , that i knew how it was !	4.529661713588792
but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .	1073.8229445312968
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .	238922717.48270243
an hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and mr. gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn .	376116142.6353921
chapter v.	1
i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .	583224.575684218
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best .	1746034.0053015852
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?	15.046552231962515
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ?	176.99151904058368
his temptation is not adequate to the risk .	8.297939777163663
do you really think so ?	2.60714034664881
cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .	5.338170699033301
upon my word said mrs. gardiner , i begin to be of your uncle's opinion .	44.068939891645385
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	547.3320490796393
i cannot think so very ill of wickham .	5.521480659811308
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ?	168.56765736510246
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .	5.762476433123961
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .	14.47241558538799
if , indeed , it should be so !	4.239113562908198
but i dare not hope it .	3.339596780003526
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ?	45.58711753081708
in the first place replied mr. gardiner , there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland .	195.6163675527751
oh !	1
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !	44.78810628637382
and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road .	95.0874736060413
well , then -- supposing them to be in london .	12.2860896254018
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .	171.31334849809514
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland .	38802.661367675246
but why all this secrecy ?	2.468112525911012
why any fear of detection ?	2.6209922209340317
why must their marriage be private ?	4.017112990699191
oh !	1
no , no , this is not likely .	5.72277807254219
his most particular friend , you see by jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	433.07363609183056
wickham will never marry a woman without some money .	11.55693842714342
he cannot afford it .	2.036468931603412
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?	74854.96949331823
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .	112065.98483348546
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good .	49.2496169147731
lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter .	278378943.63488877
but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?	4851.996026241954
it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	21135.64082570474
but , really , i know not what to say .	11.304254638805844
perhaps i am not doing her justice .	4.268413357181987
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	234309.97784961172
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	1892.739845117888
since the ---- shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .	989.0095238419271
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall i call it ?	1336.4433735270384
susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .	15.238081464049944
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman .	209.0524399134861
but you see that jane said her aunt , does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt .	816.9828737450771
of whom does jane ever think ill ?	5.67630424376399
and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?	4690.435989948443
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is .	35.81773764315212
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .	44.21034278995847
that he has neither integrity nor honour .	4.636555721518616
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating .	16.94652227771115
and do you really know all this ?	4.545211176600974
cried mrs. gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .	58.314778814318124
i do , indeed replied elizabeth , colouring .	4.826833061270575
i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .	284876.7000064184
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .	6917.684151920344
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .	300.2822987407088
yet he knew to the contrary himself .	5.854354629730349
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her .	43.28059387915384
but does lydia know nothing of this ?	5.2645138111633045
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ?	49.43376578446453
oh , yes !	1.3219882805632093
-- that , that is the worst of all .	7.757562943083971
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr. darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .	1759.2030406895788
and when i returned home , the ---- shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time .	195.6596322329088
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?	20121597.39120862
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .	1662.6581041262853
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	49.041175955192266
that such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts .	261.1689881407125
when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other .	659.9631759312667
not the slightest .	1.4342431298341614
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .	77122.34558841932
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .	178.6188309349461
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites .	2313531133.8241873
it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	3893637.1713844314
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .	5.784412892964983
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .	535.299974971779
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day .	733.4009875830088
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .	107.1545926150447
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .	1996190489.153687
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .	55151.85507344937
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .	12744.687997550473
not yet replied jane .	2.0246928194204794
but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well .	76.98359714202417
is my father in town ?	2.850354858498803
yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word .	19.6490943714924
and have you heard from him often ?	4.894742603441638
we have heard only once .	2.6365876401720016
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do .	7471.578556962119
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention .	168.66834403279307
and my mother -- how is she ?	5.705387312491149
how are you all ?	1.8472423104659224
my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .	75.70176498970885
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .	48.34236333234511
she does not yet leave her dressing-room .	4.604235207269256
mary and kitty , thank heaven !	3.7520564094911597
are quite well .	1.4310360521915098
but you -- how are you ?	3.7032045022471256
cried elizabeth .	1
you look pale .	1.4342431298341614
how much you must have gone through !	4.295446644586948
her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	263197.89203744405
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .	245.11460736319793
when they were all in the drawing-room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give .	22922.562843074502
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .	38755597.12598882
mrs. bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	3619757633.0491347
if i had been able said she , to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her .	63094.09207114976
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?	26.133379549541235
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .	13664.720067817785
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over-ruled , as i always am .	470.92718249004014
poor dear child !	1.4169625342781615
and now here's mr. bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	22273.333890066184
the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do .	22177.466037436126
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and mr. gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia .	2692851.5045741717
do not give way to useless alarm added he , though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	9045.769471775162
it is not quite a week since they left brighton .	10.196915365035387
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .	215770.8587299121
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done .	71859.44578110315
oh !	1
my dear brother replied mrs. bennet , that is exactly what i could most wish for .	74.09298999659111
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry .	6354.828186061034
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	50016.81483983989
and , above all things , keep mr. bennet from fighting .	23.512903551399283
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , -- that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day .	156723967.48054653
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .	9070.272688363366
oh , brother , how kind you are !	7.506511083208985
i know you will contrive it all .	5.380442259754544
but mr. gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	1221423180.9331272
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .	67122202620.96248
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .	3300.267944221018
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette .	19.10452509834605
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty .	7093135.5867373515
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table ,	5080.570997046499
this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of .	44.34894369018935
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation .	1638.1426287329
then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable -- that one false step involves her in endless ruin -- that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , -- and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex .	241938337399.8347
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	97.79556052323996
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .	200.8994686828166
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy .	111056.1959845175
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard .	32903037.923587233
give me farther particulars .	2.028468146928064
what did colonel forster say ?	2.6019356341693505
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	26.552386702596486
they must have seen them together for ever .	5.978321870372725
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .	1277.8452339893922
i am so grieved for him .	3.3215283277927843
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .	11.129236982779524
he was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey .	73974.71346798561
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ?	10.525996511338755
did he know of their intending to go off ?	10.646280209792282
had colonel forster seen denny himself ?	4.012189973434566
yes ; but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .	986.540069847805
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying -- and from that i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .	800.6919348137516
and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ?	492.5566919582276
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !	25.064448211548402
i felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .	6746.889665850722
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .	213.33647798398692
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .	4284.4382608659735
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks .	97.14510616723223
but not before they went to brighton ?	5.257375175495305
no , i believe not .	1.8633427443404604
and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ?	12.58078978382578
does he know his real character ?	3.3969988830634166
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .	92.71342849540326
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .	5.974869098173796
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false .	2101.263772576894
oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened !	663.180393636
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister .	7.974797296540086
but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	470.43428499647916
we acted with the best intentions .	4.095263728799246
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife ?	23.017882043461622
he brought it with him for us to see .	8.564941710584163
jane then took it from her pocket-book , and gave it to elizabeth .	42.558972956027226
these were the contents	1.414242340476086
my dear harriet ,	1.439903065762566
you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning , as soon as i am missed .	3462.405563640966
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .	58427.95207880116
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .	83.75685245643129
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham .	121092.8787447189
what a good joke it will be !	3.9881243090688416
i can hardly write for laughing .	3.545772458516684
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to-night .	255.3783868964955
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .	6433.857383140513
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	31509.78481307397
good bye .	1
give my love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey .	81.04964637813794
your affectionate friend ,	1.43990070768993
lydia bennet.	1
oh !	1
thoughtless , thoughtless lydia !	2.0049025560718388
cried elizabeth when she had finished it .	5.128811451229169
what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .	24.749573335290698
but at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .	63.492996411407916
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .	135.69513372951937
my poor father !	1.4169599194046465
how he must have felt it !	3.3917121506155965
i never saw any one so shocked .	4.270257250984867
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .	11.181145275038057
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !	30.285971497042688
oh !	1
jane cried elizabeth , was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?	888.854805138829
i do not know .	1.8722227182579063
-- i hope there was .	2.654490160459907
-- but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .	26.818392550503496
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !	4884.011228398432
but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties .	95.18078916410036
your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .	14.270702361438687
you do not look well .	2.175673940381614
oh !	1
that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone .	76.61737734876543
mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them .	4613.050061102828
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	707.3523516885149
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me .	1848.3355682832869
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us .	1285732.9493621914
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth ; perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .	18043.84080574222
assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable .	5.873365819520157
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied .	31.617555972173943
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .	1468.774023012152
he meant , i believe replied jane , to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	49287.20012575039
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .	312.4093006103723
it had come with a fare from london ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham .	70291.5743518474
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .	593658.6477533433
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this .	129562.23873981196
chapter vi.	1
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .	3410.9721494769938
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .	4819.85078841382
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .	1895.316435231397
mr. gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .	27.765802273116552
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .	537099972.6000876
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .	2585.257294137789
she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	375.5035354990983
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .	29984923.55996809
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .	816.4957907814953
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .	17213.545525795125
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	6135.428402311385
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .	21439596365.189526
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street .	323366.56903248245
that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr. bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings .	41232903.83272133
mr. gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .	3574.293170235496
he added , that mr. bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon .	396.26013287137613
there was also a postscript to this effect .	7.121018126383911
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .	4905309.2449175455
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .	6332.224711166203
at present we have nothing to guide us .	6.745999353938984
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .	205.271730619169
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person .	1582.6638069939097
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .	77977.23797916382
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .	1296.339900441199
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ---- shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	240649.79232927633
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	1262.402511039637
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience .	35.458668138228596
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	3275.57517168059
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr. collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .	709681316.0236282
it was as follows	1.4142400360193044
my dear sir ,	1.3790639211073685
i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire .	327278.02100255835
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs. collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .	1222740.9965681212
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .	196508.4778747098
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .	32.42623571059051
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .	123048105139.45868
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair .	77472.53062084378
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .	269636.324928711
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .	93199.13498066945
let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .	345809.57983480947
i am , dear sir , &c .	4.02696824338345
&c .	1
mr. gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	3223.9362564669705
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .	4704.732778575505
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .	5896.764339260727
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .	185.4527476951795
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .	1535943.7538126633
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton .	206.5237371921344
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .	149.1578924569219
mr. gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror .	230.96195467140203
a gamester !	1
she cried .	1
this is wholly unexpected .	2.0238957570975202
i had not an idea of it .	4.557802601036535
mr. gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .	878.1109334794124
rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .	427642.2632507312
when mrs. bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .	6887.028128592998
what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia !	14.497278935973634
she cried .	1
sure he will not leave london before he has found them .	16.108353784352772
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ?	52.239089144167984
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr. bennet came from it .	6550.0995138125745
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .	426.41642675013736
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	1609.042663814513
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	60573.63975390431
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley .	30.628787380057975
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better .	1031716152.9897336
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	50.787383398606636
when mr. bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .	40.698436815343456
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .	129636.77448580992
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , say nothing of that .	331324.8864108308
who should suffer but myself ?	2.840542868295102
it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it .	17.913232845761712
you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth .	10.450617138558258
you may well warn me against such an evil .	9.77219360269245
human nature is so prone to fall into it !	10.620980140409333
no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame .	78.09932446078055
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	11.858354196370849
it will pass away soon enough .	4.063994281610313
do you suppose them to be in london ?	6.298587356692013
yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ?	16.142427164322957
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty .	17.84399718430483
she is happy , then said her father , drily ; and her residence there will probably be of some duration .	393.0270253635978
then , after a short silence , he continued , lizzy , i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind .	231367.3687221026
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .	29.506273734420976
this is a parade cried he , which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !	294.4395765938043
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can , -- or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away .	1353869.1711674952
i am not going to run away , papa said kitty , fretfully ; if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia .	3303.681939053397
you go to brighton !	2.0429855095601677
-- i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds !	62.45504172482095
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .	394.9616377732216
no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .	178.68316124771246
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	57.50997492186622
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner .	6086.999626564842
kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .	76.79633722719173
well , well said he , do not make yourself unhappy .	12.645968352362784
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them .	710.5773750927061
chapter vii.	1
two days after mr. bennet's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask .	7780454706849.489
what do you mean , hill ?	3.342551215063586
we have heard nothing from town .	3.7246014210942016
dear madam cried mrs. hill , in great astonishment , don't you know there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner ?	1300.126230201514
he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter .	36.28246992249626
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .	83.23944285959267
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library ; -- their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said ,	1900177.8319329587
if you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse .	92.6120001958017
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .	60071.404082281784
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out ,	107795.17123401907
oh , papa , what news ?	4.0852677161320905
what news ?	1
have you heard from my uncle ?	3.759059072416872
yes , i have had a letter from him by express .	11.174380439756193
well , and what news does it bring ?	5.081471628769224
good or bad ?	1.304309388506323
what is there of good to be expected ?	7.060791366747215
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; but perhaps you would like to read it .	134.9136989399624
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .	5.7818399279457315
jane now came up .	2.029548922035727
read it aloud said their father , for i hardly know myself what it is about .	51.19017577262743
gracechurch-street , monday ,	1.4379486066109712
august 2 .	1
my dear brother ,	1.3751660343746868
at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction .	3788.725943375147
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were .	469.8056685081227
the particulars , i reserve till we meet .	6.915932662100385
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both ----	45.45711232097168
then it is , as i always hoped cried jane ; they are married !	30.990940786943685
elizabeth read on ; i have seen them both .	9.786292567444665
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are .	720759.0608141683
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .	184119940.66754627
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you .	2531.988258571336
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .	167.42830694122
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr. wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .	1331.9592454984092
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .	381809.0419526974
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .	194995.7160980116
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .	3404.4473028747816
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly .	85.28937115676423
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .	702.4417209037226
she comes to us to-day .	2.8700890236104195
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .	29.016499076830407
your's , &c .	1.2318354519587884
edw. gardiner.	1
is it possible !	1.4162633107308926
cried elizabeth , when she had finished .	3.985213937041337
can it be possible that he will marry her ?	7.73260272399009
wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him said her sister .	77.43045882099673
my dear father , i congratulate you .	4.240988744394998
and have you answered the letter ?	3.711195943035742
said elizabeth .	1
no ; but it must be done soon .	5.822126398357167
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .	81.46049159293334
oh !	1
my dear father she cried , come back , and write immediately .	18.7302691993004
consider how important every moment is , in such a case .	17.76768584258403
let me write for you said jane , if you dislike the trouble yourself .	38.86269512307341
i dislike it very much he replied ; but it must be done .	31.710716984391553
and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .	56.22331552827542
and may i ask ?	2.03549497781882
said elizabeth , but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with .	20.386550391744358
complied with !	1
i am only ashamed of his asking so little .	9.813711569986616
and they must marry !	1.8417670680250002
yet he is such a man !	2.9650386985660098
yes , yes , they must marry .	4.366859003876368
there is nothing else to be done .	3.916581982930327
but there are two things that i want very much to know -- one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how i am ever to pay him .	379795.332461181
money !	1
my uncle !	1
cried jane , what do you mean , sir ?	7.4661888309747235
i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life , and fifty after i am gone .	25134.21885050522
that is very true said elizabeth ; though it had not occurred to me before .	48.33666322872721
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	23.586674370896496
oh !	1
it must be my uncle's doings !	3.1415041206895555
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself .	20.35206700246116
a small sum could not do all this .	7.055075156978109
no said her father , wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	305.63403433484405
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship .	111.18582176970807
ten thousand pounds !	1.1491340261737542
heaven forbid !	1
how is half such a sum to be repaid ?	11.561324171064008
mr. bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .	270.1857019104692
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast-room .	79.48753280872894
and they are really to be married !	4.291659107212859
cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .	5.186958842974306
how strange this is !	2.0070199000488618
and for this we are to be thankful .	6.087788137202549
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !	1232.462394471833
oh , lydia !	1.4169608492399777
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane , that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .	1125.3210074752867
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .	3556.7915266887894
he has children of his own , and may have more .	16.226434973215643
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ?	6.507841627679068
if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been said elizabeth , and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .	1715466.262048328
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .	9.099526106062646
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	7927.134671454008
by this time she is actually with them !	6.589729358350522
if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !	120.92554466563129
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt !	19.817393106294507
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy .	1074.9694377530843
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .	429.4873342807926
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten .	23985.620957433344
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth , as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget .	496.4643344841194
it is useless to talk of it .	5.0646591432478445
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .	262.58473280006166
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .	644.5185233257989
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied ,	31.140043001461837
just as you please .	1.90764622974122
may we take my uncle's letter to read to her ?	16.5289275714958
take whatever you like , and get away .	7.9602047921406145
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .	43.902886420412244
mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet one communication would , therefore , do for all .	92.4661843752422
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .	43.61917129583233
mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself .	3.792895590033223
as soon as jane had read mr. gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .	4452.674964081593
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	295.34849997108813
to know that her daughter would be married was enough .	12.090511670412697
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .	251.056586004703
my dear , dear lydia !	2.5028162755151087
she cried this is delightful indeed !	4.017391058766329
-- she will be married !	2.470337529732195
-- i shall see her again !	3.0780922994575843
-- she will be married at sixteen !	4.9671209032034485
-- my good , kind brother !	3.898987913756551
-- i knew how it would be -- i knew he would manage every thing .	45.60795674360503
how i long to see her !	2.26226530436265
and to see dear wickham too !	4.0130833212354
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !	5.341281648766776
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly .	15.123709547307405
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .	294.000234918474
stay , stay , i will go myself .	5.143767821035966
ring the bell , kitty , for hill .	6.35147394175399
i will put on my things in a moment .	11.25311490807093
my dear , dear lydia !	2.5028162755151087
-- how merry we shall be together when we meet !	12.717990191716304
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr. gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .	11020.198842143627
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added , in a great measure , to his kindness .	135.1247753716284
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr. wickham with money .	49.33155895901901
well cried her mother , it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?	157.08843893449622
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	262568.8030021383
well !	1
i am so happy .	1.7661548325926986
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married .	14.866494572228131
mrs. wickham !	1
how well it sounds .	2.0283324341184197
and she was only sixteen last june .	3.6129599455990293
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me .	2017.1388139614705
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately .	208.75968467883442
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .	3364894.4033663734
one day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .	1306.7460670568548
other schemes too came into her head .	5.767831495571631
i will go to meryton said she , as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips .	1420.6553747001974
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs. long .	59.55019373583988
kitty , run down and order the carriage .	7.6748131772802966
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure .	43.8401300696103
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ?	18.52536182536125
oh !	1
here comes hill .	1.4342401933990527
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ?	12.43407319985457
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding .	941.727596439054
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy .	6.930652608957939
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	3537.5041051160306
poor lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .	969.6835149394199
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .	4162373.3360412302
chapter viii.	1
mr. bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .	1136402.679729147
he now wished it more than ever .	5.300314482538428
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	15253.238939495304
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	3301.936647698637
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .	12175791.53298143
when first mr. bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son .	1672.5688417800006
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .	11205.430863841477
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mrs. bennet , for many years after lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .	7292.5410824313885
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .	174.6218884169492
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .	441.25240204029683
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and the children .	39.44885000070602
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	258.1014435147232
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr. bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .	9910.69566696172
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .	577482.1372977071
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	11645.038946028484
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .	32647219.68767315
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .	89559.57038937956
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	2177.538753910642
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .	213.29178139091422
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her .	3860.3085412905725
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	77.81363747090184
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .	9.908568519786565
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .	78348.23780552401
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .	56290620.68856404
it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .	24235.817130164207
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .	16.56598177272446
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .	9189376.909826878
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .	50239.57089339954
haye-park might do said she , if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing-room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off !	13421.20374629568
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful .	419.8911723808365
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .	52.41173042008313
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , mrs. bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	61882.93637585679
into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	28.187396900774942
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn .	43.438147169714256
a long dispute followed this declaration ; but mr. bennet was firm it soon led to another ; and mrs. bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .	412477.8768507456
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .	108.3084900023558
mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend it .	3.8043200234643684
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .	80342.93974223723
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	299771.3425601098
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .	750407857.7605603
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .	23.58254240619539
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .	54781.89864787647
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	3560.951877769733
had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr. darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .	13153064.141413674
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .	15.641856736927094
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .	4760.993900805142
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what .	100.7038854866462
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .	127.95949580848514
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .	59.00831091395886
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet .	196.0607003724502
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !	31657.611141489466
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .	76.22672276728964
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .	16.75886664191264
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .	782.9526237369322
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .	85.32756040009316
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .	5279030.314152194
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .	120.90114493303254
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .	793.5192716347053
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .	74.13592185280106
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	9301.001878983088
mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .	7.1415992064344485
to mr. bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .	105099.44784482599
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr. wickham had resolved on quitting the militia .	271.4135623033165
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed on .	223.9403251113259
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .	3313.62998930274
it is mr. wickham's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	16893.450219989154
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general ---- 's regiment , now quartered in the north .	211.75171497452482
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .	47.74905084224172
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	3484.5652067197125
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself .	812872.6812455208
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	5419.727334259929
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us .	124.01593571764084
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .	34.30213918691119
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from mrs. gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south .	51884.84212912521
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother .	65.66489997819237
-- your's , &c .	1.7421196982412979
e. gardiner.	1
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the ---- shire , as clearly as mr. gardiner could do .	1249.303378032004
but mrs. bennet , was not so well pleased with it .	8.925031524180783
lydia's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .	1062946902.5749164
she is so fond of mrs. forster said she , it will be quite shocking to send her away !	175.26593571253463
and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .	58.5106654848986
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ---- 's regiment .	19.4441800799586
his daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative .	21918.899602996615
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .	6139610789.315414
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north .	3824.1021838483084
when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn .	66065.17625745996
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	34211.793118866335
chapter ix.	1
their sister's wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .	256.89085434490835
the carriage was sent to meet them at ---- , and they were to return in it , by dinner-time .	186.62261029671416
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .	604335.9037835202
they came .	1
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .	22.44845606597826
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .	7313.623927026806
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	244.23515891675805
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .	872163.2380896593
their reception from mr. bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	62.089546979047725
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .	35.707540150925375
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .	44.102496081331196
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked .	10.788852621117117
lydia was lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .	100.1219513782293
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .	4811342.367252305
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .	3154662.550797244
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .	34167.69056926807
she blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	839.7661489977608
there was no want of discourse .	2.861992755917485
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	1639300.9147824054
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .	25.742825076153817
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .	2983.0923930621557
only think of its being three months she cried , since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .	23879.036809258778
good gracious !	1
when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again !	305.6893090658149
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was .	20.392517005543507
her father lifted up his eyes .	4.073756235337136
jane was distressed .	1.431037112236665
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , oh !	4471.213024872015
mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to-day ?	29.78068357228153
i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing .	3728489776.4102945
elizabeth could bear it no longer .	4.073637821898951
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour .	2672.349920439707
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , ah !	15282.580887288106
jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman .	220.67826138134077
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .	513.0574224952737
her ease and good spirits increased .	3.418897618979075
she longed to see mrs. philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called mrs. wickham by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs. hill and the two housemaids .	12887514.94702066
well , mamma said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , and what do you think of my husband ?	349.9339931747626
is not he a charming man ?	3.7318051017211777
i am sure my sisters must all envy me .	8.389046753060953
i only hope they may have half my good luck .	13.771228549755147
they must all go to brighton .	4.00645186310539
that is the place to get husbands .	4.761759329709163
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go .	37.450584770482386
very true ; and if i had my will , we should .	22.42150301897744
but my dear lydia , i don't at all like your going such a way off .	103.55823535076476
must it be so ?	1.8474666098427985
oh , lord !	1.3399299990975744
yes ; -- there is nothing in that .	5.4769176642158195
i shall like it of all things .	5.501175962573792
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .	56.44912712899776
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all .	3994.187837075294
i should like it beyond any thing !	4.223729189253343
said her mother .	1.2213597541687446
and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over .	22017.659158934304
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth ; but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands .	501.93612797726564
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	20.293049011434135
mr. wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .	555.7465554829871
no one but mrs. bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .	60556.72947016046
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .	4375.348049296214
wickham's affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to lydia's for him .	294.5503197791954
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .	1703672352282.8481
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .	4.098411973289638
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .	256.9308485159737
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .	6664.386753303152
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth ,	425.84062185841844
lizzy , i never gave you an account of my wedding , i believe .	31.633419206855155
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it .	69.92247770398373
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ?	13.037075017625051
no really replied elizabeth ; i think there cannot be too little said on the subject .	74.59830679310765
la !	1
you are so strange !	1.8377956781124742
but i must tell you how it went off .	7.928105494426717
we were married , you know , at st .	8.34364521925814
clement's , because wickham's lodgings were in that parish .	11.62271184335408
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .	28.0058919745534
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .	154.70359388866132
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !	19.23279182364768
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted .	563.7002279390507
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .	1592.990996307871
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .	665.5844263290687
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .	30.880922254294795
well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; i thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them .	251940.22103831577
if you'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .	303.5578284333293
not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	16.709581224819797
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open .	72.80902927342579
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone .	1835.1311005526036
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .	93.78913796151598
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .	36373.12273091022
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .	189.4426002353463
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr. darcy might have done as well .	4300.658633675501
mr. darcy !	1
repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .	4.079166313140667
oh , yes !	1.3219882805632093
-- he was to come there with wickham , you know .	14.1262410538684
but gracious me !	1.416959372637351
i quite forgot !	1.4169637805717217
i ought not to have said a word about it .	12.342637018113287
i promised them so faithfully !	2.8397931531402376
what will wickham say ?	2.004916488199018
it was to be such a secret !	3.685962901770329
if it was to be secret said jane , say not another word on the subject .	67.10634785053283
you may depend upon my seeking no further .	6.455643805247825
oh !	1
certainly said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; we will ask you no questions .	59.663810518327345
thank you said lydia , for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry .	447.3965752490622
on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .	242.66153209772088
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .	695.1114393335706
mr. darcy had been at her sister's wedding .	5.8021231328724046
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .	1576.664752490804
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .	473.65093580055196
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .	198.0569651571749
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .	465885.05917822034
you may readily comprehend she added , what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .	489349.22764956986
pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance .	215070.63345274754
not that i shall though she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out .	245926.43326913792
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .	1629875.8803771562
chapter x.	1
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	85.22420632860381
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	8358111.395014201
gracechurch-street , sept .	1.4342431298341614
6 .	1
my dear niece ,	1.4399009269749874
i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you .	16349.115899291455
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you .	91.9011942973704
don't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .	3689.25767885864
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .	20.01094788356765
your uncle is as much surprised as i am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .	15111.798197907094
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .	35.509446858153055
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .	135.01314383155133
mr. darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	21.49979005065285
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been .	565.564596994275
he came to tell mr. gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once .	18168.77853883279
from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .	3344.8492792106053
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .	229682.65757829012
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .	7365.55660193059
his character was to speak for itself .	5.238910060773445
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	1888.0826604096414
if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him .	30.22241518900207
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	454327.88220796536
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs. younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .	47633.67035941586
she then took a large house in edward-street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .	178.7756723608674
this mrs. younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .	3467.1930832011108
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .	60.2218662799431
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	1736.5551254059935
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .	10849.303926627419
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished-for direction .	19.98044368651962
they were in ---- street .	2.4134051983330767
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .	11.808567066522551
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .	729209.3493919692
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .	19.6133582664335
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .	397.6438586762501
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .	97.97321361427254
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .	139732.44161887115
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .	172104.5671735754
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	415.5641005859345
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .	209.86445243238066
mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	32.905141066355924
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .	2498.1485100061127
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .	6510.503858379194
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .	96.14159748276944
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed .	20.90267265782575
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .	154.05357940957066
every thing being settled between them mr. darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch-street the evening before i came home .	8377.139709822097
but mr. gardiner could not be seen , and mr. darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	5922.275983229768
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .	19935.841375036
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .	497.765119254132
on saturday he came again .	2.871827248847418
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .	852.3595860871518
they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too .	22.68615089270989
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .	209.51248809473344
but our visitor was very obstinate .	4.077586528772502
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .	91.73925190223615
he has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .	86.93909225361594
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .	130055.588569267
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	673.5224131468666
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .	34448128122.51096
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .	77.54428626170836
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people .	47.98252491342847
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased .	29747.405699631527
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above .	207.48820854393747
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .	26332.505605947117
perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody's reserve , can be answerable for the event .	1871.087691869307
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .	107488.51237233769
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .	2480690.7192636137
i believe i have now told you every thing .	10.18527605688086
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .	1617.266056152778
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .	35.61720859746109
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .	1192777624.3930602
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .	14169.888493968405
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen .	128.93004151272785
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .	1047.2703010302205
mr. darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	96.73418321639485
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .	136.6824599367845
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him .	11518.953454808512
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire .	234.66481196279986
his understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him .	5130.50808516863
i thought him very sly ; -- he hardly ever mentioned your name .	46.546960936379634
but slyness seems the fashion .	2.8953955090203047
pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park .	196864.0690302299
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .	96.51198155720726
but i must write no more .	3.416930144565789
the children have been wanting me this half hour .	10.85031548013303
your's , very sincerely ,	2.0364342169784746
m. gardiner.	1
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .	4584.9636522121755
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	734874113.1634548
he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .	228205133624.02734
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .	51.07265207901728
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .	19.354300012353125
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .	17162001.16109401
brother-in-law of wickham !	1.4164960236828044
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .	10.658355207826668
he had to be sure done much .	4.396707481784326
she was ashamed to think how much .	5.555733909601097
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .	117.58954105854895
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .	167052577.15602222
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .	755.9990328011419
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him .	49.02955916430325
oh !	1
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .	993.6544866544695
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .	22.150251662171268
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	186.52284763970493
she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .	19.24540827759548
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .	7.7924932527135224
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself .	60117.40453068367
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham .	5693.122207665099
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ?	18.62015844397217
said he , as he joined her .	3.4609819831699102
you certainly do she replied with a smile ; but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome .	255.29222414886735
i should be sorry indeed , if it were .	7.976907533234815
we were always good friends ; and now we are better .	16.17034291566563
true .	1
are the others coming out ?	2.836650979663589
i do not know .	1.8722227182579063
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .	16.608393704593254
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley .	223.04494785081917
she replied in the affirmative .	2.7331721657905232
i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .	4288.479745570828
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ?	8.243982606412368
poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me .	9.958030109660227
but of course she did not mention my name to you .	15.078791591533557
yes , she did .	1.3866883337359417
and what did she say ?	2.84418237461162
that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well .	140.10977539968138
at such a distance as that you know , things are strangely misrepresented .	26.96304673886641
certainly he replied , biting his lips .	4.558419564618277
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said ,	22.39343830450822
i was surprised to see darcy in town last month .	16.52939002344712
we passed each other several times .	4.053961648067268
i wonder what he can be doing there .	7.488529794888745
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth .	16.685088468599076
it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year .	65.02819296044198
undoubtedly .	1
did you see him while you were at lambton ?	10.55715081704791
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had .	13.907408072583378
yes ; he introduced us to his sister .	8.186627438886621
and do you like her ?	2.483531783414291
very much .	1
i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .	50.373536911279714
when i last saw her , she was not very promising .	14.053247694736845
i am very glad you liked her .	5.484719459169412
i hope she will turn out well .	5.738568877080826
i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age .	42.28759900754947
did you go by the village of kympton ?	7.51426500947243
i do not recollect that we did .	4.177596040185493
i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had .	46.6187648857772
a most delightful place !	1.8390262497318355
-- excellent parsonage house !	2.004527167524033
it would have suited me in every respect .	5.173955462330692
how should you have liked making sermons ?	5.208982349975053
exceedingly well .	1
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .	159.342276966317
one ought not to repine ; -- but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !	246.79152372688125
the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !	192.6074616485168
but it was not to be .	2.300370922016401
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ?	54.19815329198945
i have heard from authority , which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron .	1717.3223238328958
you have .	1
yes , there was something in that i told you so from the first , you may remember .	93.90095644718257
i did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly .	1151921.5034637824
you did !	1
and it was not wholly without foundation .	3.667274362405702
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it .	143.29659412913477
they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good-humoured smile ,	209265.7637064351
come , mr. wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	24.314678727125592
do not let us quarrel about the past .	7.652205588462076
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind .	21.842547769890327
she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .	1566.1684327824476
chapter xi.	1
mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .	705267.514427169
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came , and mrs. bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .	1036117.755749011
oh !	1
my dear lydia she cried , when shall we meet again ?	17.65081845826208
oh , lord !	1.3399299990975744
i don't know .	1.434238767786445
not these two or three years perhaps .	4.388940998465755
write to me very often , my dear .	5.693614642818776
as often as i can .	2.4954081506375374
but you know married women have never much time for writing .	23.134975871150885
my sisters may write to me .	3.8499962394390264
they will have nothing else to do .	5.045748774925451
mr. wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .	15.018604044919893
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .	14.319748976007949
he is as fine a fellow said mr. bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , as ever i saw .	476.7124061826005
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .	30.293490919451077
i am prodigiously proud of him .	3.8068513415992498
i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son-in-law .	53.01609038729723
the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days .	34.62667853579177
i often think said she , that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .	78.36231361251107
one seems so forlorn without them .	4.067602835757378
this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter said elizabeth .	71.92053765347366
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single .	32.80931979067453
it is no such thing .	2.662587033270875
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .	779.909099149576
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon .	20.08261655415373
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	200957.60573364707
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .	12534.863966680485
mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets .	4.614546371208908
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .	34.266046950395605
well , well , and so mr. bingley is coming down , sister ( for mrs. philips first brought her the news .	739.7360110855826
) well , so much the better .	4.477687103197717
not that i care about it , though .	4.8245735049132135
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again .	203.0895595981285
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it .	51.37718947254578
and who knows what may happen ?	4.015935142606555
but that is nothing to us .	3.216796916149861
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .	82.71118831434516
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ?	12.586475827057955
you may depend on it replied the other , for mrs. nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .	670488.3977437767
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday .	47.650266340395184
she was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed .	33387.81252602301
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .	35.325193579186134
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said ,	1370.6549699645334
i saw you look at me to-day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed .	1385.1446363254668
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause .	11.60165898935344
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i should be looked at .	91.87532599267969
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .	81.92041555545812
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .	324.58855592876057
not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people's remarks .	22.531533232190608
elizabeth did not know what to make of it .	6.710997854314904
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	78208760.4049521
yet it is hard she sometimes thought , that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !	6375.218193164236
i will leave him to himself .	4.107721558444539
in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .	11780.822615597102
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	43.17596246595673
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .	470.3263861154983
as soon as ever mr. bingley comes , my dear said mrs. bennet , you will wait on him of course .	186.38923835524398
no , no .	1.232858088657816
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .	1469.9086295251682
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again .	87.47673042229229
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield .	1263.5197628532353
'tis an etiquette i despise said he .	5.758293210574489
if he wants our society , let him seek it .	16.637330138867508
he knows where we live .	2.8708061651897303
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again .	315.32471657350953
well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .	149.2845935698646
but , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined .	77.77624756660494
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon .	10.022004210981928
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him .	143.52109030487867
consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr. bingley in consequence of it , before they did .	84873.43082660082
as the day of his arrival drew near ,	6.532911684884067
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister .	53.54391901559009
it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .	587.5139146224753
my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says .	505.58984565766673
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over !	33.011257328871196
i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth ; but it is wholly out of my power .	241.25126333754702
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much .	1216.5571917639847
mr. bingley arrived .	1.4342410324254191
mrs. bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .	20380.607214414904
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .	293.8202720126763
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing-room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .	3692.5045225211243
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .	16.663419601672224
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window -- she looked , -- she saw mr. darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .	109577.2332904731
there is a gentleman with him , mamma said kitty ; who can it be ?	42.25803387825715
some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know .	86.84062896827349
la !	1
replied kitty , it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .	117.93892843872295
mr. what's his name .	2.0285835690557645
that tall , proud man .	2.8701994707009018
good gracious !	1
mr. darcy !	1
-- and so it does i vow .	5.332118838097847
well , any friend of mr. bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him .	6040.125797608423
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern .	8.216901073501786
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .	30872.192027411405
both sisters were uncomfortable enough .	2.863875141428179
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr. darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr. bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .	376245.73065611813
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs. gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .	42480.80986756045
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley .	8791577694.561947
her astonishment at his coming -- at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire .	57701.6467859685
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .	2298918.7011364433
but she would not be secure .	2.322308743746681
let me first see how he behaves said she ; it will then be early enough for expectation .	157.73511834076766
she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .	87383.34549418109
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected .	59.64886849822249
on the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	44007.04231842575
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	3845.513577561365
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .	8.152419246748089
he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley .	2166.656484989534
but , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	128.1394001513674
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .	14.795038386559618
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .	529.2243498620855
he was received by mrs. bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .	69943.85435977796
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	127854.21779389694
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .	2062.7691976930423
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire .	714.2809266352639
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .	30.301563314799537
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .	29909613.824162826
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .	175.84636147408392
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .	21.270905049910123
could i expect it to be otherwise !	4.013955770803971
said she .	1
yet why did he come ?	2.4001592303930623
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	420.22625238291874
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more .	16.450018170948653
it is a long time , mr. bingley , since you went away said mrs. bennet .	42.22063781377516
he readily agreed to it .	2.7334733548440173
i began to be afraid you would never come back again .	16.505939211480555
people did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .	565.1518591826635
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	36.67163038692879
miss lucas is married and settled .	4.0911341874677705
and one of my own daughters .	2.5857415289948302
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	108.46445564718242
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .	538.153655258098
it was only said , 'lately , george wickham , esq .	18.818596466091957
to miss lydia bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .	2445.995212595556
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .	681.3656767331051
did you see it ?	1.8587908860237312
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	8.91413407548446
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	5.092869027606569
how mr. darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .	11.798487918348556
it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married continued her mother , but at the same time , mr. bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .	47357.15035359898
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long .	3591.1253072127297
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the ---- shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .	1295.6615562607801
thank heaven !	1
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves .	47.27326669736021
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	1118.497488864453
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .	36955.4352500779
a few weeks , he believed .	2.852905635693804
when you have killed all your own birds , mr. bingley said her mother , i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr. bennet's manor .	21394.51923022875
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .	446.84298375297834
elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !	21.685164890490125
were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .	14259.382295853751
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .	1486.8235331697697
the first wish of my heart said she to herself , is never more to be in company with either of them .	322.2842722131876
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !	93.6577999808268
let me never see either one or the other again !	14.91862222401358
yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover .	90539.75596542163
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	3075.1952501092665
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .	859.7573382244975
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	1236.4547304525966
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .	89.44226082642548
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs. bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time .	6547.937185409821
you are quite a visit in my debt , mr. bingley she added , for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	58433.55777194971
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement .	2176.2620230563516
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .	396.1363185491147
they then went away .	1.8975701137387262
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year .	1009299318.7909346
chapter xii.	1
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .	19655.117004004023
mr. darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .	5.820521606825167
why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent said she , did he come at all ?	440.7052921328149
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .	23.503795402607317
he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?	1262.6213599154541
if he fears me , why come hither ?	7.505159472981298
if he no longer cares for me , why silent ?	13.075556179918628
teazing , teazing , man !	2.8867467800795565
i will think no more about him .	5.2861800740305664
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth .	30484.219254927655
now said she , that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .	42.276056394941556
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .	77.2586100292035
i am glad he dines here on tuesday .	6.9584851515685795
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance .	337.4774449018079
yes , very indifferent indeed said elizabeth , laughingly .	7.5895547008791535
oh , jane , take care .	3.1093444848168494
my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now .	53.24720645247481
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .	197.5023881408746
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and mrs. bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .	640242.4481919957
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .	11790.34622952291
when they repaired to the dining-room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .	28366.40188321175
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .	176.9039375994966
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile it was decided .	993.2415165639711
he placed himself by her .	2.7176378451145413
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .	16.335320515313065
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr. darcy , with an expression of half-laughing alarm .	69268.73134173486
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .	493822.6783460582
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .	143.15555086785787
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .	179.6048804289643
mr. darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .	36.163415115720696
he was on one side of her mother .	6.850580776331921
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .	354.5230609360907
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .	45199.02662354542
her mother's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	3638427.35354215
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .	1079428.9468524319
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing-room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .	12054.904532331082
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .	575.4375345121889
if he does not come to me , then said she , i shall give him up for ever .	81.62343581506174
the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !	230.166750980845
the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .	503395.51836889214
and on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper ,	411.1427239743412
the men shan't come and part us , i am determined .	18.911249203502056
we want none of them ; do we ?	6.613542614372602
darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	12.919849313313863
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	37810.69873122887
a man who has once been refused !	4.861966214408322
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?	56.4583461176493
is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?	1182.4088437673279
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings !	8.868843348490078
she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying ,	531.92639832057
is your sister at pemberley still ?	3.688662589327224
yes , she will remain there till christmas .	6.953228951933264
and quite alone ?	1.4170950912574019
have all her friends left her ?	3.7015601641984404
mrs. annesley is with her .	2.891886412956113
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks .	33.54219257281449
she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .	422.1371799364115
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .	4843.3810974890475
when the tea-things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	203174035.65994206
she now lost every expectation of pleasure .	5.46573208987893
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	78258.7121480361
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .	14699.04805786031
well girls said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , what say you to the day ?	175.1319068533737
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .	28.77103208554766
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .	18.593450224444716
the venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .	387.63082572895456
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week ; and even mr. darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least .	284023.16173483734
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .	21.680795586822335
mrs. long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .	42.76078672294233
and what do you think she said besides ?	6.591436189720583
'ah !	1
mrs. bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last .'	13.01781065176616
she did indeed .	1.35392992332672
i do think mrs. long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously .	11101.04618014828
mrs. bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .	818943277.5669456
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth .	23.64506983160558
the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .	47.56169000475304
i hope we may often meet again .	5.003847128048656
elizabeth smiled .	1
lizzy , you must not do so .	3.325900919981521
you must not suspect me .	2.2886056701203557
it mortifies me .	1.4342390651600754
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .	1864.5370743078374
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	443.121229842784
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man .	854.8971283523099
you are very cruel said her sister , you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment .	401.7008761346821
how hard it is in some cases to be believed !	16.379129203607047
and how impossible in others !	2.8537721027799847
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ?	65.87248116471109
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer .	16.59399999483024
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .	123.54285096090678
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .	59.406872195254316
chapter xiii.	1
a few days after this visit , mr. bingley called again , and alone .	29.666833876015016
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time .	235.54188350271951
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	36.722670550481034
mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .	452.5956564876553
next time you call said she , i hope we shall be more lucky .	33.91196485451837
he should be particularly happy at any time , &c .	12.677329040319629
&c .	1
; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	158.8078411183036
can you come to-morrow ?	2.0042587299175136
yes , he had no engagement at all for to-morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .	102.02795653634526
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .	69.62213283576345
in ran mrs. bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out ,	865.4510086275393
my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .	7.065993823842317
he is come -- mr. bingley is come .	5.823611529522522
-- he is , indeed .	2.2786138248632932
make haste , make haste .	2.2189447644033757
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .	195.96827740777982
never mind miss lizzy's hair .	2.868574398783179
we will be down as soon as we can said jane ; but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago .	7446.369663879505
oh !	1
hang kitty !	1
what has she to do with it ?	5.772723415328497
come be quick , be quick !	4.088837969710416
where is your sash my dear ?	4.013518605463492
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .	231.79121954568612
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .	77.74917885252903
after tea , mr. bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument .	777.9555050315811
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .	10681.719392141647
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , what is the matter mamma ?	726.0536799773424
what do you keep winking at me for ?	6.232863522714313
what am i to do ?	2.4941606017705804
nothing child , nothing .	2.0285649179483127
i did not wink at you .	3.0620871511987167
she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty ,	2985.0941227164512
come here , my love , i want to speak to you took her out of the room .	127.20171065107496
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .	1995.5820711742354
in a few minutes , mrs. bennet half opened the door and called out ,	28.872706353525672
lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you .	13.80743754931902
elizabeth was forced to go .	1.9715044427440311
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	272.44895523793485
kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room .	21.468586510317394
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing-room .	6723.1371215674835
mrs. bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual .	8.17515288304142
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	73.2786540134388
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .	1396864.6864186376
