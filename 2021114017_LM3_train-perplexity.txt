stately , plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed .	1212.456479785788
a yellow dressinggown , ungirdled , was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air .	116.05291895157562
he held the bowl aloft and intoned	3.5153084383406616
introibo ad altare dei .	2.0414565120591095
halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely	32.803106874053846
come up , kinch !	1.838091017915985
come up , you fearful jesuit !	3.69955088611712
solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest .	10.104275113548411
he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower , the surrounding land and the awaking mountains .	128.42963797416283
then , catching sight of stephen dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head .	4489.898845842869
stephen dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak .	2662021.0471707094
buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly .	67.65557913838359
back to barracks !	1.4187722396036229
he said sternly .	1.4435177552826162
he added in a preacher’s tone	2.84633749445515
for this , o dearly beloved , is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns .	214.25219102769643
slow music , please .	2.0375444113974375
shut your eyes , gents .	2.640039232934413
one moment .	1
a little trouble about those white corpuscles .	5.783759392388487
silence , all .	1.4425200345803175
he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points .	16920.502125271058
chrysostomos .	1
two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm .	8.267221068202895
thanks , old chap , he cried briskly .	6.591406561990174
that will do nicely .	1.676867835200172
switch off the current , will you ?	4.355430444103868
he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher , gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown .	1000.2890057644797
the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages .	296.20293142077145
a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips .	7.477026395337534
the mockery of it !	1.7482650778510964
he said gaily .	1.4412020528143703
your absurd name , an ancient greek !	5.782224306520347
he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself .	130.6344486772701
stephen dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .	466958.8437393526
buck mulligan’s gay voice went on .	4.098080224241361
my name is absurd too malachi mulligan , two dactyls .	13.286740746543284
but it has a hellenic ring , hasn’t it ?	11.663206345306158
tripping and sunny like the buck himself .	5.851034842596274
we must go to athens .	2.9057750239857145
will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ?	61.484914109617904
he laid the brush aside and , laughing with delight , cried	20.57442494425608
will he come ?	1.4182788265058508
the jejune jesuit !	1.4187714101233442
ceasing , he began to shave with care .	6.751011372322415
tell me , mulligan , stephen said quietly .	4.163023416714022
yes , my love ?	1.853238734264866
how long is haines going to stay in this tower ?	16.291644308868698
buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder .	16.528261038029676
god , isn’t he dreadful ?	2.8458213766548828
he said frankly .	1.4435178964393902
a ponderous saxon .	1.4435178023358575
he thinks you’re not a gentleman .	3.5589928841021066
god , these bloody english !	2.838295437801701
bursting with money and indigestion .	2.6713484257368854
because he comes from oxford .	2.8925839919471374
you know , dedalus , you have the real oxford manner .	12.239878744393883
he can’t make you out .	2.8951367853967556
o , my name for you is the best kinch , the knife-blade .	27.836930356133294
he shaved warily over his chin .	4.10095396570086
he was raving all night about a black panther , stephen said .	32.07020604724617
where is his guncase ?	2.0072273053101073
a woful lunatic !	1.4187722396036229
mulligan said .	1
were you in a funk ?	2.6493206152017326
i was , stephen said with energy and growing fear .	9.940404144385155
out here in the dark with a man i don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther .	432.81328435734184
you saved men from drowning .	2.6497435385719523
i’m not a hero , however .	3.1320067930146926
if he stays on here i am off .	7.543642338053678
buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade .	9.93909490102299
he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily .	55.99350541571125
scutter !	1
he cried thickly .	1.4435178964393902
he came over to the gunrest and , thrusting a hand into stephen’s upper pocket , said	87.08951727606045
lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor .	23.528921739810215
stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief .	269.73210966879856
buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly .	3.8769929193879085
then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said	7.050842490168162
the bard’s noserag !	1.4187722396036229
a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen .	10.633486165705696
you can almost taste it , can’t you ?	6.90055748817757
he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly .	337.46032969171983
god !	1
he said quietly .	1.3137086586859246
isn’t the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother ?	19.12162502556126
the snotgreen sea .	1.4435175648189749
the scrotumtightening sea .	1.4435175648189749
epi oinopa ponton .	1.4435178964393902
ah , dedalus , the greeks !	3.7171844068856155
i must teach you .	2.045380971328349
you must read them in the original .	4.5427233232663955
thalatta !	1
thalatta !	1
she is our great sweet mother .	3.8452838882009877
come and look .	1.4427449316755436
stephen stood up and went over to the parapet .	7.736582781559906
leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown .	108.41147080308349
our mighty mother !	1.2455532757095502
buck mulligan said .	1.2610538345157212
he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen’s face .	38.358958273100505
the aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said .	12.586263152992958
that’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you .	26.491350099506548
someone killed her , stephen said gloomily .	4.23078844799022
you could have knelt down , damn it , kinch , when your dying mother asked you , buck mulligan said .	446.7350422723683
i’m hyperborean as much as you .	3.2471990140328777
but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her .	225.6349676946429
and you refused .	1.4435176141169919
there is something sinister in you... .	4.113027022683923
he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek .	15.515616324586171
a tolerant smile curled his lips .	4.093326741174232
but a lovely mummer !	2.0064730627090217
he murmured to himself .	2.0408021120564857
kinch , the loveliest mummer of them all !	5.572593850779358
he shaved evenly and with care , in silence , seriously .	22.34591146037534
stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve .	3532.7014011178017
pain , that was not yet the pain of love , fretted his heart .	40.910237021862095
silently , in a dream she had come to him after her death , her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , that had bent upon him , mute , reproachful , a faint odour of wetted ashes .	2851910.404392269
across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him .	359.0928088721619
the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid .	41.290346979154855
a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting .	12714.812327924807
buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade .	3.7602314020981176
ah , poor dogsbody !	1.7963098046672183
he said in a kind voice .	3.3149691812537623
i must give you a shirt and a few noserags .	12.903034379463765
how are the secondhand breeks ?	2.6031395626983223
they fit well enough , stephen answered .	5.867579922694738
buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip .	8.298509860373665
the mockery of it , he said contentedly .	3.5958466143622667
secondleg they should be .	2.042341722141822
god knows what poxy bowsy left them off .	8.180542978150763
i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey .	18.565929397410816
you’ll look spiffing in them .	2.910789425410569
i’m not joking , kinch .	2.930768533227631
you look damn well when you’re dressed .	5.780755838995904
thanks , stephen said .	2.044066670304306
i can’t wear them if they are grey .	6.902461558771892
he can’t wear them , buck mulligan told his face in the mirror .	27.332320703455856
etiquette is etiquette .	1.4435178964393902
he kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers .	15.044966740450834
he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin .	95.84001583687356
stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes .	100.71040386694995
that fellow i was with in the ship last night , said buck mulligan , says you have g .	216.63374240626695
p .	1
i .	1
he’s up in dottyville with connolly norman .	5.798182610121487
general paralysis of the insane !	2.870821311757674
he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea .	811.6274410034515
his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth .	44.2399904808718
laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk .	5.7999316452472
look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard !	10.686413858061222
stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack .	166.3724009102758
hair on end .	1.4435175371138302
as he and others see me .	3.929211250138188
who chose this face for me ?	4.031515340706987
this dogsbody to rid of vermin .	4.125094424911092
it asks me too .	2.039067900676963
i pinched it out of the skivvy’s room , buck mulligan said .	19.432654897484277
it does her all right .	2.8852815553993745
the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi .	8.193310410118293
lead him not into temptation .	2.888978408995569
and her name is ursula .	2.6525567896902364
laughing again , he brought the mirror away from stephen’s peering eyes .	26.5151993748736
the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said .	83.1288847609987
if wilde were only alive to see you !	6.607128869172963
drawing back and pointing , stephen said with bitterness	5.346747712149404
it is a symbol of irish art .	3.9836153468859354
the cracked lookingglass of a servant .	2.9545293805908495
buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen’s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them .	9372.642932862818
it’s not fair to tease you like that , kinch , is it ?	24.023623035907786
he said kindly .	1.3129656477869507
god knows you have more spirit than any of them .	15.162387574838407
parried again .	1
he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his .	47.695002596675046
the cold steel pen .	2.041510218850345
cracked lookingglass of a servant !	1.8434095322981392
tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea .	32.54349171737705
he’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman .	13.177400564077024
his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other .	163.60478774933804
god , kinch , if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island .	181.64127091401855
hellenise it .	1
cranly’s arm .	1
his arm .	1
and to think of your having to beg from these swine .	19.673185764843215
i’m the only one that knows what you are .	11.50248664178184
why don’t you trust me more ?	3.497909345414883
what have you up your nose against me ?	6.806535470099861
is it haines ?	1.419319758664249
if he makes any noise here i’ll bring down seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe .	877.5326163660454
young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe’s rooms .	11.634314703649213
palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter , one clasping another .	23.665145323298972
o , i shall expire !	2.21798965864577
break the news to her gently , aubrey !	7.544276351817929
i shall die !	1.418770788003526
with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by ades of magdalen with the tailor’s shears .	27637.190974393532
a scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade .	5.80067096896502
i don’t want to be debagged !	3.133087896794148
don’t you play the giddy ox with me !	7.6578205500480525
shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle .	12.172500422271677
a deaf gardener , aproned , masked with matthew arnold’s face , pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms .	3955.501587685164
to ourselves.. .	1
new paganism.. .	1
omphalos .	1
let him stay , stephen said .	4.1626618613416495
there’s nothing wrong with him except at night .	7.160965885655954
then what is it ?	1.7567357254336917
buck mulligan asked impatiently .	1.7756817619951257
cough it up .	1.3783571995346244
i’m quite frank with you .	2.899296810588706
what have you against me now ?	3.384430743748943
they halted , looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale .	991.2603806966152
stephen freed his arm quietly .	2.887516103004786
do you wish me to tell you ?	5.72293789439093
he asked .	1
yes , what is it ?	2.511453856670374
buck mulligan answered .	1.3581066161857613
i don’t remember anything .	1.8696862764250886
he looked in stephen’s face as he spoke .	7.897075735479154
a light wind passed his brow , fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes .	938.78904513955
stephen , depressed by his own voice , said	8.206467496794195
do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother’s death ?	46.16217666369037
buck mulligan frowned quickly and said	2.623597803805927
what ?	1
where ?	1
i can’t remember anything .	2.038432092072843
i remember only ideas and sensations .	4.1250542707524795
why ?	1
what happened in the name of god ?	4.467903381537886
you were making tea , stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water .	183.3643488305
your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom .	11.944248859161382
she asked you who was in your room .	6.598077122254371
yes ?	1
buck mulligan said .	1.2610538345157212
what did i say ?	2.035955323096825
i forget .	1
you said , stephen answered , o , it’s only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead .	69.22729349467012
a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan’s cheek .	94.25061682319976
did i say that ?	1.623898845764049
he asked .	1
well ?	1
what harm is that ?	2.0133811248580695
he shook his constraint from him nervously .	5.7979377448662275
and what is death , he asked , your mother’s or yours or my own ?	82.16038570309345
you saw only your mother die .	4.087199293841628
i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom .	358.43822516021294
it’s a beastly thing and nothing else .	5.835989327857584
it simply doesn’t matter .	2.0415576285963883
you wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you .	100.59955580513349
why ?	1
because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you , only it’s injected the wrong way .	109.58447766909075
to me it’s all a mockery and beastly .	8.31300156886099
her cerebral lobes are not functioning .	4.090165441831193
she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt .	47.26729172128483
humour her till it’s over .	2.8903162705106826
you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don’t whinge like some hired mute from lalouette’s .	1523.5331595451294
absurd !	1
i suppose i did say it .	4.096441441104054
i didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother .	13.075035402379996
he had spoken himself into boldness .	4.087494739567755
stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly	157.92436511202314
i am not thinking of the offence to my mother .	11.916384442532085
of what then ?	1.41792719731791
buck mulligan asked .	1.4254165163885937
of the offence to me , stephen answered .	6.361262448261206
buck mulligan swung round on his heel .	5.822960380793865
o , an impossible person !	2.8378489498263795
he exclaimed .	1
he walked off quickly round the parapet .	5.8332810871985155
stephen stood at his post , gazing over the calm sea towards the headland .	58.30013867882465
sea and headland now grew dim .	4.086273350514061
pulses were beating in his eyes , veiling their sight , and he felt the fever of his cheeks .	190.25322262886058
a voice within the tower called loudly	3.713273085703015
are you up there , mulligan ?	3.745291074645169
i’m coming , buck mulligan answered .	3.0519837628542406
he turned towards stephen and said	2.6244795439533775
look at the sea .	1.5928894942933312
what does it care about offences ?	4.018514769060677
chuck loyola , kinch , and come on down .	9.780673381578135
the sassenach wants his morning rashers .	4.101527886908011
his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase , level with the roof	137.43176888588474
don’t mope over it all day , he said .	10.155152281096093
i’m inconsequent .	1
give up the moody brooding .	2.8870706491941163
his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead	42.20667146663695
and no more turn aside and brood upon love’s bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars .	98.81956989360609
woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed .	87.43555917423198
inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened , spurned by lightshod hurrying feet .	96.45676511519991
white breast of the dim sea .	4.131324894111427
the twining stresses , two by two .	5.063438507310217
a hand plucking the harpstrings , merging their twining chords .	16.83933023018583
wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide .	8.290994660849865
a cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green .	122.23931275871414
it lay beneath him , a bowl of bitter waters .	11.948085394313088
fergus’ song i sang it alone in the house , holding down the long dark chords .	104.61707161554253
her door was open she wanted to hear my music .	14.336749019746067
silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside .	13.608494696525764
she was crying in her wretched bed .	5.833518804063844
for those words , stephen love’s bitter mystery .	7.3664778544658995
where now ?	1
her secrets old featherfans , tasselled dancecards , powdered with musk , a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer .	803.910992679255
a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl .	50.90909574016082
she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang	254.1527394629792
i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility .	5.471519954506745
phantasmal mirth , folded away muskperfumed .	4.084698989178922
and no more turn aside and brood .	3.741195177257853
folded away in the memory of nature with her toys .	12.392316530575654
memories beset his brooding brain .	2.8871379348662596
her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament .	52.51249014578358
a cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening .	513.4978107333392
her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts .	55.64285732076851
in a dream , silently , she had come to him , her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , bent over him with mute secret words , a faint odour of wetted ashes .	458032.3438257631
her glazing eyes , staring out of death , to shake and bend my soul .	81.56128144673895
on me alone .	1.4435175713377828
the ghostcandle to light her agony .	4.095191419656443
ghostly light on the tortured face .	4.132558961429834
her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror , while all prayed on their knees .	59.750705499812106
her eyes on me to strike me down .	8.243741888861857
liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat .	21.181213601746354
ghoul !	1
chewer of corpses !	1.4187722396036229
no , mother !	1.418770956796539
let me be and let me live .	4.807528974358944
kinch ahoy !	1
buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower .	7.4878316311981505
it came nearer up the staircase , calling again .	10.125092808484638
stephen , still trembling at his soul’s cry , heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words .	452.5162559002982
dedalus , come down , like a good mosey .	9.274549925289918
breakfast is ready .	1.441201950675081
haines is apologising for waking us last night .	8.187758112772013
it’s all right .	1.4283313608798014
i’m coming , stephen said , turning .	4.13552972514131
do , for jesus’ sake , buck mulligan said .	10.24055029672829
for my sake and for all our sakes .	6.5338852287010365
his head disappeared and reappeared .	2.9167883507289547
i told him your symbol of irish art .	7.153614509118596
he says it’s very clever .	2.8878865647869008
touch him for a quid , will you ?	4.314654630440567
a guinea , i mean .	2.5293220661352924
i get paid this morning , stephen said .	6.630644883954532
the school kip ?	1.4193212175477754
buck mulligan said .	1.2610538345157212
how much ?	1
four quid ?	1
lend us one .	1.4435175652822902
if you want it , stephen said .	4.468590638206511
four shining sovereigns , buck mulligan cried with delight .	7.913574247015048
we’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids .	16.63183021390527
four omnipotent sovereigns .	1.4435175576482642
he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs , singing out of tune with a cockney accent	325.21699578264605
o , won’t we have a merry time , drinking whisky , beer and wine !	74.27358038975511
on coronation , coronation day !	2.8364110438767014
o , won’t we have a merry time on coronation day !	17.207623157923273
warm sunshine merrying over the sea .	3.9537427030540124
the nickel shavingbowl shone , forgotten , on the parapet .	12.49934154213134
why should i bring it down ?	4.028955104560562
or leave it there all day , forgotten friendship ?	10.056110445640462
he went over to it , held it in his hands awhile , feeling its coolness , smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck .	8712.974820858288
so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes .	16.71348084046236
i am another now and yet the same .	8.344935252826355
a servant too .	1.443517521193017
a server of a servant .	2.907050819299301
in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow .	4489.748374651586
two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated , turning .	37885.3866761782
we’ll be choked , buck mulligan said .	5.120067153209108
haines , open that door , will you ?	6.182666171600117
stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker .	5.361043980583438
a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting , went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors .	714.8136539840124
have you the key ?	1.5672609134781794
a voice asked .	1.3857876010747228
dedalus has it , buck mulligan said .	4.296048899704379
janey mack , i’m choked !	2.8380378577250105
he howled , without looking up from the fire	5.6452233436053865
kinch !	1
it’s in the lock , stephen said , coming forward .	10.623550688081448
the key scraped round harshly twice and , when the heavy door had been set ajar , welcome light and bright air entered .	1095.5295330366425
haines stood at the doorway , looking out .	5.776172662875789
stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait .	26.802214166752155
buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him .	17.190370054952847
then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table , set them down heavily and sighed with relief .	510.7737211748246
i’m melting , he said , as the candle remarked when.. .	13.985442998154783
but , hush !	1.4187712718752075
not a word more on that subject !	5.246977440180003
kinch , wake up !	2.0093608141439665
bread , butter , honey .	2.688733700296717
haines , come in .	2.051580310017457
the grub is ready .	2.0382705803492382
bless us , o lord , and these thy gifts .	12.648951893502376
where’s the sugar ?	1.4193205002691514
o , jay , there’s no milk .	5.881885681897101
stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker .	84.50973845010607
buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet .	5.669619078083072
what sort of a kip is this ?	4.339836238919677
he said .	1
i told her to come after eight .	4.843313261187115
we can drink it black , stephen said thirstily .	8.488354934979679
there’s a lemon in the locker .	4.1498124022956935
o , damn you and your paris fads !	7.604571808439922
buck mulligan said .	1.2610538345157212
i want sandycove milk .	2.0417029815142627
haines came in from the doorway and said quietly	5.247296849475686
that woman is coming up with the milk .	7.223264410361539
the blessings of god on you !	4.030734615388775
buck mulligan cried , jumping up from his chair .	9.28037946025069
sit down .	1
pour out the tea there .	2.517904966094468
the sugar is in the bag .	3.2323592311271594
here , i can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs .	15.191659103990196
he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates , saying	93.62247694689692
in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti .	8.167092591850599
haines sat down to pour out the tea .	6.1403223367583095
i’m giving you two lumps each , he said .	11.574572066245734
but , i say , mulligan , you do make strong tea , don’t you ?	36.155505563489754
buck mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old woman’s wheedling voice	100.22158522925953
when i makes tea i makes tea , as old mother grogan said .	34.895890734436286
and when i makes water i makes water .	6.117129115361446
by jove , it is tea , haines said .	7.1243946666712885
buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling	4.055390386863582
so i do , mrs cahill says she .	7.6140132071745805
begob , ma’am says mrs cahill , god send you don’t make them in the one pot .	130.39703801447428
he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled on his knife .	155.84008708687531
that’s folk , he said very earnestly , for your book , haines .	27.37170855892833
five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum .	197.28389811144456
printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind .	24.563482150049136
he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice , lifting his brows	49.42563486864368
can you recall , brother , is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads ?	1126.7288928679775
i doubt it , said stephen gravely .	5.398318907271496
do you now ?	1.4186282377448869
buck mulligan said in the same tone .	3.38697380826958
your reasons , pray ?	2.004862022990413
i fancy , stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion .	131.3053656320174
mother grogan was , one imagines , a kinswoman of mary ann .	34.44119868580373
buck mulligan’s face smiled with delight .	4.089862013298533
charming !	1
he said in a finical sweet voice , showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly .	169.70977896557613
do you think she was ?	2.2199499646096954
quite charming !	1
then , suddenly overclouding all his features , he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf	929.567781660655
for old mary ann	1.4142524036527682
she doesn’t care a damn .	2.9053236158447024
but , hising up her petticoats.. .	3.777921697750788
he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned .	15.342461361402002
the doorway was darkened by an entering form .	8.191598779857177
the milk , sir !	1.8386994897119109
come in , ma’am , mulligan said .	4.397490305625014
kinch , get the jug .	2.920929317523731
an old woman came forward and stood by stephen’s elbow .	12.103724097606634
that’s a lovely morning , sir , she said .	7.2069650693265315
glory be to god .	1.9308797025190012
to whom ?	1
mulligan said , glancing at her .	2.948098742887075
ah , to be sure !	2.289477852674996
stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker .	15.429756510756222
the islanders , mulligan said to haines casually , speak frequently of the collector of prepuces .	95.14431993923242
how much , sir ?	2.0049870969712758
asked the old woman .	1.736132866710805
a quart , stephen said .	2.6532684281782615
he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk , not hers .	252.97051242493364
old shrunken paps .	1.4435178964393902
she poured again a measureful and a tilly .	8.353673241004374
old and secret she had entered from a morning world , maybe a messenger .	67.64981185235538
she praised the goodness of the milk , pouring it out .	20.678596151192075
crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field , a witch on her toadstool , her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs .	4556.489338744263
they lowed about her whom they knew , dewsilky cattle .	15.29315751624703
silk of the kine and poor old woman , names given her in old times .	83.34718616175942
a wandering crone , lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer , their common cuckquean , a messenger from the secret morning .	6545.583858146975
to serve or to upbraid , whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour .	167.1057506528412
it is indeed , ma’am , buck mulligan said , pouring milk into their cups .	71.75324228035876
taste it , sir , she said .	3.069704551376163
he drank at her bidding .	2.8951179019712536
if we could live on good food like that , he said to her somewhat loudly , we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts .	4377.685857022668
living in a bogswamp , eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust , horsedung and consumptives’ spits .	397.13369640298816
are you a medical student , sir ?	4.855330458375899
the old woman asked .	1.6099595480700606
i am , ma’am , buck mulligan answered .	5.360806837518097
look at that now , she said .	4.137891662180873
stephen listened in scornful silence .	2.8872723372943074
she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly , her bonesetter , her medicineman me she slights .	1034.8809427300885
to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins , of man’s flesh made not in god’s likeness , the serpent’s prey .	63583.383029350036
and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes .	74.57626131263744
do you understand what he says ?	3.220796760471684
stephen asked her .	1.4423516237009513
is it french you are talking , sir ?	7.811811740583593
the old woman said to haines .	3.5988002976201745
haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently .	14.290035866131593
irish , buck mulligan said .	2.514696320538563
is there gaelic on you ?	2.851665156985461
i thought it was irish , she said , by the sound of it .	24.394158847060062
are you from the west , sir ?	4.3627286614135805
i am an englishman , haines answered .	5.3832763523712535
he’s english , buck mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland .	92.42866480176801
sure we ought to , the old woman said , and i’m ashamed i don’t speak the language myself .	223.25025004399174
i’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows .	16.53943539366292
grand is no name for it , said buck mulligan .	13.906458865959957
wonderful entirely .	1
fill us out some more tea , kinch .	8.297525493788958
would you like a cup , ma’am ?	5.3090233296793805
no , thank you , sir , the old woman said , slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go .	1880.5419712925823
haines said to her	1.2418074404449944
have you your bill ?	2.0072737164333403
we had better pay her , mulligan , hadn’t we ?	12.192371803303779
stephen filled again the three cups .	4.132014635837848
bill , sir ?	1.4173930415107234
she said , halting .	1.608648684334591
well , it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling .	24365.72678959823
that’s a shilling and one and two is two and two , sir .	37.076058162466815
buck mulligan sighed and , having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides , stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets .	8098.48150728031
pay up and look pleasant , haines said to him , smiling .	16.31863070694705
stephen filled a third cup , a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk .	136.86323537560784
buck mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried	56.597708240652665
a miracle !	1
he passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying	16.525568870121536
ask nothing more of me , sweet .	5.4437938662762555
all i can give you i give .	5.407876260662672
stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand .	7.5683558859172155
we’ll owe twopence , he said .	3.873947177019588
time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin .	9.984331963127588
time enough .	1
good morning , sir .	1.9876801213419828
she curtseyed and went out , followed by buck mulligan’s tender chant	18.97599645328103
heart of my heart , were it more ,	6.640565491761038
more would be laid at your feet .	5.792185353128831
he turned to stephen and said	2.638006902886288
seriously , dedalus .	1.4423515113863523
i’m stony .	1
hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money .	30.342865419613133
today the bards must drink and junket .	5.1775400875249185
ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty .	23.255579942989534
that reminds me , haines said , rising , that i have to visit your national library today .	98.24301881108211
our swim first , buck mulligan said .	5.120065611258134
he turned to stephen and asked blandly	3.3784761545908712
is this the day for your monthly wash , kinch ?	15.039624891103635
then he said to haines	1.7051794248852574
the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month .	20.915440685788774
all ireland is washed by the gulfstream , stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf .	407.6515925160778
haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke	287.21422968722595
i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me .	42.214186160205685
speaking to me .	1.3775590510502558
they wash and tub and scrub .	4.125001803104989
agenbite of inwit .	1.358106418961725
conscience .	1
yet here’s a spot .	2.0415316950035627
that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good .	101.94429360692396
buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone	37.60582837919597
wait till you hear him on hamlet , haines .	11.240681127974064
well , i mean it , haines said , still speaking to stephen .	19.886090851782946
i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in .	35.77560366698778
would i make any money by it ?	5.708289856552024
stephen asked .	1
haines laughed and , as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock , said	147.02244964660613
i don’t know , i’m sure .	3.4506364179584
he strolled out to the doorway .	3.0291203471651302
buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour	12.092955650162617
you put your hoof in it now .	5.344668731678946
what did you say that for ?	3.247290690671553
well ?	1
stephen said .	1
the problem is to get money .	4.11102932205581
from whom ?	1
from the milkwoman or from him .	3.725956432647985
it’s a toss up , i think .	5.070958094703787
i blow him out about you , buck mulligan said , and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes .	1573.7025896886107
i see little hope , stephen said , from her or from him .	31.984428056461773
buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen’s arm .	17.20411252224845
from me , kinch , he said .	3.8434226251522148
in a suddenly changed tone he added	4.012373623781225
to tell you the god’s truth i think you’re right .	11.233420375500817
damn all else they are good for .	5.59055391301372
why don’t you play them as i do ?	6.447041408255205
to hell with them all .	2.702115145649366
let us get out of the kip .	3.7556405117201717
he stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly	51.991850206536355
mulligan is stripped of his garments .	4.143219140566587
he emptied his pockets on to the table .	8.193288124219052
there’s your snotrag , he said .	4.089294764934266
and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them , chiding them , and to his dangling watchchain .	740.8018651314484
his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief .	95.67305399189385
god , we’ll simply have to dress the character .	11.621790904433352
i want puce gloves and green boots .	5.178178808894859
contradiction .	1
do i contradict myself ?	1.8529887106733778
very well then , i contradict myself .	5.222844938670978
mercurial malachi .	1
a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands .	12.49130147684925
and there’s your latin quarter hat , he said .	11.038601494475188
stephen picked it up and put it on .	5.968900439720758
haines called to them from the doorway	4.058751419544626
are you coming , you fellows ?	3.9067084626462454
i’m ready , buck mulligan answered , going towards the door .	16.74844776224305
come out , kinch .	2.0359310412341287
you have eaten all we left , i suppose .	9.194838711922188
resigned he passed out with grave words and gait , saying , wellnigh with sorrow	49.791483597020886
and going forth he met butterly .	4.095268618425865
stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it .	10095.315695678186
he put the huge key in his inner pocket .	10.353576201959205
at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked	6.132795424630222
did you bring the key ?	2.870610365145177
i have it , stephen said , preceding them .	7.074853010342062
he walked on .	1.4279913372555528
behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses .	269.9176450397235
down , sir !	1.416823935749935
how dare you , sir !	1.984504402453783
haines asked	1
do you pay rent for this tower ?	5.697481961501387
twelve quid , buck mulligan said .	3.556783904891997
to the secretary of state for war , stephen added over his shoulder .	39.30267025204081
they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last	16.396002642438063
rather bleak in wintertime , i should say .	7.973129191809406
martello you call it ?	1.9716506131194473
billy pitt had them built , buck mulligan said , when the french were on the sea .	89.59305436046141
but ours is the omphalos .	2.92092235061445
what is your idea of hamlet ?	3.529665137335724
haines asked stephen .	1.4412019548097534
no , no , buck mulligan shouted in pain .	6.547756346231786
i’m not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up .	255.40855095127756
wait till i have a few pints in me first .	11.0735477932685
he turned to stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat	105.36561659680943
you couldn’t manage it under three pints , kinch , could you ?	23.890590701443504
it has waited so long , stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer .	48.86396985084501
you pique my curiosity , haines said amiably .	6.375405077074018
is it some paradox ?	2.0072421217830723
pooh !	1
buck mulligan said .	1.2610538345157212
we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes .	8.348190825133884
it’s quite simple .	1.4435178561097866
he proves by algebra that hamlet’s grandson is shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father .	415.92436266720085
what ?	1
haines said , beginning to point at stephen .	5.551127249877231
he himself ?	1
buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to stephen’s ear	279.8234506331667
o , shade of kinch the elder !	5.80121828358523
japhet in search of a father !	3.77830123571621
we’re always tired in the morning , stephen said to haines .	13.64791906522327
and it is rather long to tell .	4.627658760752885
buck mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands .	11.625444111714975
the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus , he said .	42.28985913027023
i mean to say , haines explained to stephen as they followed , this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore .	1647.1147186375845
that beetles o’er his base into the sea isn’t it ?	13.419410135766398
buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak .	37.57990876543873
in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires .	226.01191007120917
it’s a wonderful tale , haines said , bringing them to halt again .	32.05105835895039
eyes , pale as the sea the wind had freshened , paler , firm and prudent .	140.22741836396435
the seas’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins .	21664.75465466975
i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere , he said bemused .	24.153317994539506
the father and the son idea .	3.1156069684910617
the son striving to be atoned with the father .	11.686843860286483
buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face .	23.33499597973409
he looked at them , his wellshaped mouth open happily , his eyes , from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense , blinking with mad gaiety .	4155.813087759479
he moved a doll’s head to and fro , the brims of his panama hat quivering , and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice	2851.0638323976723
i’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard .	11.61935750718995
my mother’s a jew , my father’s a bird .	9.090346205009855
with joseph the joiner i cannot agree .	4.794863616166494
so here’s to disciples and calvary .	4.1249550911295305
he held up a forefinger of warning .	5.865116652583674
if anyone thinks that i amn’t divine he’ll get no free drinks when i’m making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again .	142077.68161505795
he tugged swiftly at stephen’s ashplant in farewell and , running forward to a brow of the cliff , fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air , and chanted	278646.5436132612
goodbye , now , goodbye !	2.5424836113541236
write down all i said and tell tom , dick and harry i rose from the dead .	157.63998556848335
what’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivet’s breezy.. .	41.35676967749719
goodbye , now , goodbye !	2.5424836113541236
he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole , fluttering his winglike hands , leaping nimbly , mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries .	59790.36884183551
haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside stephen and said	42.92865604643741
we oughtn’t to laugh , i suppose .	5.6759740865556845
he’s rather blasphemous .	1.4435178964393902
i’m not a believer myself , that is to say .	13.759223527192743
still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn’t it ?	31.453167962885733
what did he call it ?	2.338207765583669
joseph the joiner ?	1.2474589297837286
the ballad of joking jesus , stephen answered .	8.29765973788239
o , haines said , you have heard it before ?	8.413201440880663
three times a day , after meals , stephen said drily .	13.26617689659159
you’re not a believer , are you ?	4.848130110060965
haines asked .	1
i mean , a believer in the narrow sense of the word .	23.90431196267245
creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god .	10.095909819099129
there’s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , stephen said .	55.07735773824479
haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone .	94.51338632984722
he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it .	11.383424768669213
thank you , stephen said , taking a cigarette .	5.558263781585296
haines helped himself and snapped the case to .	7.692825755016256
he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox , sprang it open too , and , having lit his cigarette , held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands .	283730.0142885536
yes , of course , he said , as they went on again .	25.892288076311953
either you believe or you don’t , isn’t it ?	10.434789300593785
personally i couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal god .	15.162188374334118
you don’t stand for that , i suppose ?	5.9188263914458314
you behold in me , stephen said with grim displeasure , a horrible example of free thought .	113.2253130925109
he walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side .	95.8768700414659
its ferrule followed lightly on the path , squealing at his heels .	28.536294419842818
my familiar , after me , calling , steeeeeeeeeeeephen !	10.788192951483055
a wavering line along the path .	4.12793056528314
they will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark .	34.589703965280854
he wants that key .	2.0415004407043784
it is mine .	1.4435176397841274
i paid the rent .	2.041491289508705
now i eat his salt bread .	4.101400592399216
give him the key too .	2.6529485467689256
all .	1
he will ask for it .	2.900910835169803
that was in his eyes .	2.252267191445285
after all , haines began.. .	2.372165190233622
stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind .	123.29781783758665
after all , i should think you are able to free yourself .	22.969897761937705
you are your own master , it seems to me .	14.946839464039082
i am a servant of two masters , stephen said , an english and an italian .	81.82792195369069
italian ?	1
haines said .	1
a crazy queen , old and jealous .	5.936133246051152
kneel down before me .	2.043971501809969
and a third , stephen said , there is who wants me for odd jobs .	64.29636303125434
italian ?	1
haines said again .	1.4417681002907643
what do you mean ?	1.7064598062661198
the imperial british state , stephen answered , his colour rising , and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church .	353.90017805205173
haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke .	33.24119944367871
i can quite understand that , he said calmly .	6.859372962068388
an irishman must think like that , i daresay .	7.902620096270816
we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly .	17.709754599425963
it seems history is to blame .	3.1681219645696475
the proud potent titles clanged over stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars .	594677.8362675305
symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus , the voices blended , singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs .	105545.59518816671
a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one , and arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father , and valentine , spurning christ’s terrene body , and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son .	293865191.48330635
words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger .	30.294673352396273
idle mockery .	1
the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace , a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church , michael’s host , who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields .	1438680.3806306252
hear , hear !	1.3087105991815637
prolonged applause .	1
zut !	1
nom de dieu !	1.4180726507987647
of course i’m a britisher , haines’s voice said , and i feel as one .	65.2274659877311
i don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either .	49.70791522515667
that’s our national problem , i’m afraid , just now .	16.250849694568494
two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching businessman , boatman .	48.09023322189454
she’s making for bullock harbour .	2.8870888416638465
the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain .	31.308292592028632
there’s five fathoms out there , he said .	6.247416118057613
it’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one .	43.5611130159423
it’s nine days today .	2.0418057294624883
the man that was drowned .	2.897664347414344
a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite .	3158.0797036543586
here i am .	1.3844105922309717
they followed the winding path down to the creek .	9.187327747344012
buck mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder .	153.10722446495973
a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water .	2403.3180842495804
is the brother with you , malachi ?	4.324483806369044
down in westmeath .	1.4435178964393902
with the bannons .	1.4435178964393902
still there ?	1
i got a card from bannon .	4.091141672476607
says he found a sweet young thing down there .	11.638072631314035
photo girl he calls her .	2.6241846788514698
snapshot , eh ?	1.4174020098090772
brief exposure .	1
buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots .	6.29631631673487
an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face .	50.10398272110206
he scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth .	81888.18404635145
buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at haines and stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone .	8296.830908718417
seymour’s back in town , the young man said , grasping again his spur of rock .	95.95544313138586
chucked medicine and going in for the army .	7.644554457849513
ah , go to god !	2.8540292388125925
buck mulligan said .	1.2610538345157212
going over next week to stew .	4.1073808549581114
you know that red carlisle girl , lily ?	6.306408796557548
yes .	1
spooning with him last night on the pier .	7.59496946338554
the father is rotto with money .	4.096625817167161
is she up the pole ?	2.871959743066007
better ask seymour that .	2.0487810128069364
seymour a bleeding officer !	2.0064886338063537
buck mulligan said .	1.2610538345157212
he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely	65.55879163905816
redheaded women buck like goats .	2.8901060863775707
he broke off in alarm , feeling his side under his flapping shirt .	40.685076835590806
my twelfth rib is gone , he cried .	6.653979725641696
i’m the übermensch .	1.4412020336633724
toothless kinch and i , the supermen .	5.067267124154448
he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay .	76.87861359160154
are you going in here , malachi ?	4.4144509164016945
yes .	1
make room in the bed .	2.261779108172869
the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes .	489.52814524374133
haines sat down on a stone , smoking .	5.377188767612121
are you not coming in ?	2.2348373585050165
buck mulligan asked .	1.4254165163885937
later on , haines said .	2.601383889182079
not on my breakfast .	1.8721530006929015
stephen turned away .	1.4435175082369658
i’m going , mulligan , he said .	4.905004743231925
give us that key , kinch , buck mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat .	53.66468433528827
stephen handed him the key .	2.4378436278547944
buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes .	8.227248553554242
and twopence , he said , for a pint .	7.172981244896527
throw it there .	1.4435174694991268
stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap .	7.603571116533128
dressing , undressing .	1.4435178964393902
buck mulligan erect , with joined hands before him , said solemnly	20.559739612471684
he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord .	10.551858143922818
thus spake zarathustra .	1.4435178964393902
his plump body plunged .	2.041477069994462
we’ll see you again , haines said , turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish .	322.8753972592058
horn of a bull , hoof of a horse , smile of a saxon .	66.46440801235501
the ship , buck mulligan cried .	2.830418451915292
half twelve .	1
good , stephen said .	2.044066670304306
he walked along the upwardcurving path .	3.337118361362955
liliata rutilantium .	1
turma circumdet .	1
iubilantium te virginum .	1.3945350514397867
the priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly .	23.49124352154225
i will not sleep here tonight .	3.813738395325251
home also i cannot go .	2.8880512943709387
a voice , sweettoned and sustained , called to him from the sea .	28.816003774832296
turning the curve he waved his hand .	5.8094820418725215
it called again .	1.4435174943779552
a sleek brown head , a seal’s , far out on the water , round .	61.38932399489004
usurper .	1
2	1
you , cochrane , what city sent for him ?	11.618074765936493
tarentum , sir .	1.4382673600252849
very good .	1
well ?	1
there was a battle , sir .	3.0939230453584163
very good .	1
where ?	1
the boy’s blank face asked the blank window .	8.26834893602039
fabled by the daughters of memory .	3.3786167485950633
and yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it .	37.8938693712196
a phrase , then , of impatience , thud of blake’s wings of excess .	59.77711985190073
i hear the ruin of all space , shattered glass and toppling masonry , and time one livid final flame .	404.0712168446313
what’s left us then ?	2.00853814881499
i forget the place , sir .	4.138946236128302
279 b. c.	1
asculum , stephen said , glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book .	70.54743319537707
yes , sir .	1.3467567976403798
and he said another victory like that and we are done for .	24.06490284496968
that phrase the world had remembered .	4.086621756376326
a dull ease of the mind .	3.7898883166497583
from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers , leaned upon his spear .	273.5495002160242
any general to any officers .	2.887781492566475
they lend ear .	1.4435176338150522
you , armstrong , stephen said .	3.627775801595569
what was the end of pyrrhus ?	2.3318917541008903
end of pyrrhus , sir ?	2.6022165963466883
i know , sir .	1.569731889165691
ask me , sir , comyn said .	3.5387662536015903
wait .	1
you , armstrong .	1.3880518583478803
do you know anything about pyrrhus ?	2.746676410789557
a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrong’s satchel .	10.120386706907661
he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly .	33.26534249350559
crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips .	8.367922611360152
a sweetened boy’s breath .	2.0417390863884584
welloff people , proud that their eldest son was in the navy .	22.995053017522224
vico road , dalkey .	2.0414756050557092
pyrrhus , sir ?	1.339311335978472
pyrrhus , a pier .	2.039499676820468
all laughed .	1
mirthless high malicious laughter .	2.041610111432188
armstrong looked round at his classmates , silly glee in profile .	23.792798040415637
in a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay .	645.3637323708789
tell me now , stephen said , poking the boy’s shoulder with the book , what is a pier .	210.22983967087112
a pier , sir , armstrong said .	4.0266806481145965
a thing out in the water .	3.5588086428026076
a kind of a bridge .	2.185399632960294
kingstown pier , sir .	1.775836700246682
some laughed again mirthless but with meaning .	5.803539356615651
two in the back bench whispered .	3.4391905627989736
yes .	1
they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent .	11.559487842546202
all .	1
with envy he watched their faces edith , ethel , gerty , lily .	42.354912184538655
their likes their breaths , too , sweetened with tea and jam , their bracelets tittering in the struggle .	403.85805203268654
kingstown pier , stephen said .	2.653110762911667
yes , a disappointed bridge .	2.6477529784803893
the words troubled their gaze .	2.885900078753055
how , sir ?	1.4173930415107234
comyn asked .	1
a bridge is across a river .	4.109142563528032
for haines’s chapbook .	1.4435178964393902
no-one here to hear .	2.0388287711882627
tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk , to pierce the polished mail of his mind .	127.15248388914435
what then ?	1
a jester at the court of his master , indulged and disesteemed , winning a clement master’s praise .	223.629538608776
why had they chosen all that part ?	5.70429039381801
not wholly for the smooth caress .	4.130895185000214
for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard , their land a pawnshop .	270.97535951913284
had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death .	268.0005370740093
they are not to be thought away .	3.703088627006179
time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted .	335.7872227370168
but can those have been possible seeing that they never were ?	22.863024977195238
or was that only possible which came to pass ?	9.68687846906271
weave , weaver of the wind .	4.1688008416378
tell us a story , sir .	3.6124403894830484
o , do , sir .	2.421186685884845
a ghoststory .	1
where do you begin in this ?	3.710568598942279
stephen asked , opening another book .	3.5529308892627367
weep no more comyn said .	2.5091066805973106
go on then , talbot .	2.5439531419924233
and the story , sir ?	2.312030394296094
after , stephen said .	2.044066670304306
go on , talbot .	1.7140435434356405
a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel .	136.65047179381483
he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text	16.458044798537443
weep no more , woful shepherds , weep no more for lycidas , your sorrow , is not dead , sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.. .	4202.434002236264
it must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible .	39.017261107196575
aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read , sheltered from the sin of paris , night by night .	105166.85644256235
by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy .	21.894599468259994
fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds .	221011.828884045
thought is the thought of thought .	4.126309525843907
tranquil brightness .	1
the soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms .	60.77326136619497
tranquility sudden , vast , candescent form of forms .	10.21558597856178
talbot repeated	1
through the dear might of him that walked the waves ,	13.004223102946407
through the dear might.. .	1.8720221584959231
turn over , stephen said quietly .	2.7966650432113505
i don’t see anything .	1.7747954787320253
what , sir ?	1.339311335978472
talbot asked simply , bending forward .	4.156786253871395
his hand turned the page over .	4.134852834504179
he leaned back and went on again , having just remembered .	17.585579005412725
of him that walked the waves .	3.541325438386828
here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine .	280.1312543451945
it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute .	65.14785349963412
to caesar what is caesar’s , to god what is god’s .	23.784183703104492
a long look from dark eyes , a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms .	359.05071274345346
ay .	1
riddle me , riddle me , randy ro .	6.982446674828351
my father gave me seeds to sow .	5.818829544439323
talbot slid his closed book into his satchel .	8.196016987406122
have i heard all ?	2.0102925774162177
stephen asked .	1
yes , sir .	1.3467567976403798
hockey at ten , sir .	2.6848528842471517
half day , sir .	2.043342294925807
thursday .	1
who can answer a riddle ?	2.856503313387105
stephen asked .	1
they bundled their books away , pencils clacking , pages rustling .	23.943235786365403
crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels , all gabbling gaily	23.335994436488786
a riddle , sir ?	2.0050057917679402
ask me , sir .	1.720407406947401
o , ask me , sir .	3.5004148358244005
a hard one , sir .	2.928699906015319
this is the riddle , stephen said	3.1836149012344386
the cock crew , the sky was blue the bells in heaven were striking eleven .	89.1122491771377
’tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven .	13.358175257736093
what is that ?	1.441122529075467
what , sir ?	1.339311335978472
again , sir .	1.3185092475407356
we didn’t hear .	1.4421166762350086
their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated .	11.712824085676498
after a silence cochrane said	2.0015654749347283
what is it , sir ?	1.8518653885415786
we give it up .	1.9515975893745174
stephen , his throat itching , answered	3.734512628680341
the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush .	8.257305968190455
he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay .	73.45009424118493
a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called	15.377763980111784
hockey !	1
they broke asunder , sidling out of their benches , leaping them .	28.857993323376945
quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues .	463.9821918885468
sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook .	43.29218757043081
his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading .	496.99621574280695
on his cheek , dull and bloodless , a soft stain of ink lay , dateshaped , recent and damp as a snail’s bed .	1641.6476880605212
he held out his copybook .	2.6581621933999218
the word sums was written on the headline .	7.793579963435182
beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot .	125.33609811491228
cyril sargent his name and seal .	3.7769748614118064
mr deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir .	402.71577295123313
stephen touched the edges of the book .	5.156631428149894
futility .	1
do you understand how to do them now ?	6.478356161725479
he asked .	1
numbers eleven to fifteen , sargent answered .	5.346557025498948
mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board , sir .	32.8298261297124
can you do them yourself ?	2.479230449010562
stephen asked .	1
no , sir .	1.3039149045544511
ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink , a snail’s bed .	144.74486421782163
yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in her heart .	69.62680895293917
but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot , a squashed boneless snail .	194.02464996252877
she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own .	21.522623569081464
was that then real ?	2.0073392941725703
the only true thing in life ?	3.141434667714131
his mother’s prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode .	23.54525799706329
she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire , an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes .	887.558258626606
she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been .	87.6144029345141
a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox , red reek of rapine in his fur , with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth , listened , scraped up the earth , listened , scraped and scraped .	1633134.030872633
sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem .	9.855996370593811
he proves by algebra that shakespeare’s ghost is hamlet’s grandfather .	13.476860483443023
sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses .	5.802917256652066
hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field .	139.08833561840154
across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice , in the mummery of their letters , wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes .	1719.1490211911346
give hands , traverse , bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors .	89.67451413482367
gone too from the world , averroes and moses maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend .	312224.07996397495
do you understand now ?	1.7511194995486576
can you work the second for yourself ?	5.761869036624418
yes , sir .	1.3467567976403798
in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data .	8.26185034531908
waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols , a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin .	2267.8587608675693
amor matris subjective and objective genitive .	3.3440155172093036
with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands .	545.0291768216978
like him was i , these sloping shoulders , this gracelessness .	23.99040420403581
my childhood bends beside me .	2.890941773611621
too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly .	30.454847451439743
mine is far and his secret as our eyes .	11.751273304543133
secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants , willing to be dethroned .	1848.6735443704304
the sum was done .	2.041724818942536
it is very simple , stephen said as he stood up .	11.784500064022534
yes , sir .	1.3467567976403798
thanks , sargent answered .	1.8569839994432862
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench .	217.59462027891942
you had better get your stick and go out to the others , stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form .	1079.3572608368465
yes , sir .	1.3467567976403798
in the corridor his name was heard , called from the playfield .	24.837703609249573
sargent !	1
run on , stephen said .	2.891666088552213
mr deasy is calling you .	2.8927310758881832
he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife .	387.70008011308994
they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet .	270.49205193493424
when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him .	21.755483288993787
he turned his angry white moustache .	3.7456840694591045
what is it now ?	1.6020364024491673
he cried continually without listening .	2.8879220518824713
cochrane and halliday are on the same side , sir , stephen said .	28.657025621131485
will you wait in my study for a moment , mr deasy said , till i restore order here .	178.49754112195518
and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly	54.74118680384438
what is the matter ?	1.4604627193326705
what is it now ?	1.6020364024491673
their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him , the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head .	2834.1147338183464
stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs .	143.4728431015704
as on the first day he bargained with me here .	15.186919221647294
as it was in the beginning , is now .	7.004914730115835
on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins , base treasure of a bog and ever shall be .	239.49857057692216
and snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end .	1175.072935793605
a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor .	17.569272307725203
blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table .	20.599406559071276
first , our little financial settlement , he said .	11.571365298821535
he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong .	30.7429940369538
it slapped open and he took from it two notes , one of joined halves , and laid them carefully on the table .	904.6229561311005
two , he said , strapping and stowing his pocketbook away .	17.328365514296053
and now his strongroom for the gold .	5.103200993182498
stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this , whorled as an emir’s turban , and this , the scallop of saint james .	173416.2944618908
an old pilgrim’s hoard , dead treasure , hollow shells .	16.899331711814252
a sovereign fell , bright and new , on the soft pile of the tablecloth .	70.2362036761633
three , mr deasy said , turning his little savingsbox about in his hand .	32.71609274847092
these are handy things to have .	4.108856546714513
see .	1
this is for sovereigns .	1.8720688559078627
this is for shillings .	1.8723826044853729
sixpences , halfcrowns .	1.4435178964393902

he shot from it two crowns and two shillings .	10.729729958071166
three twelve , he said .	2.8407314984719467
i think you’ll find that’s right .	4.0784594960477545
thank you , sir , stephen said , gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers .	1193.4699475541038
no thanks at all , mr deasy said .	6.4304068793203335
you have earned it .	2.047398770253233
stephen’s hand , free again , went back to the hollow shells .	26.66284983872886
symbols too of beauty and of power .	5.881319762907386
a lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery .	23.41073963710057
don’t carry it like that , mr deasy said .	5.992686777798728
you’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it .	8.287706989728587
you just buy one of these machines .	4.497677052668352
you’ll find them very handy .	2.8878751697471414
answer something .	1
mine would be often empty , stephen said .	8.326538360968662
the same room and hour , the same wisdom and i the same .	35.948676193839574
three times now .	1.4435175030816314
three nooses round me here .	2.8901153372467157
well ?	1
i can break them in this instant if i will .	16.504355654393837
because you don’t save , mr deasy said , pointing his finger .	18.335964732333853
you don’t know yet what money is .	5.038856459213499
money is power .	1.443517535687821
when you have lived as long as i have .	10.211346623623054
i know , i know .	1.9698495340816164
if youth but knew .	1.758141741049208
but what does shakespeare say ?	2.8396937163345086
put but money in thy purse .	4.113531313734241
iago , stephen murmured .	2.041475455926665
he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare .	29.705484865954613
he knew what money was , mr deasy said .	8.212014082116447
he made money .	1.4435175854736113
a poet , yes , but an englishman too .	7.819488390302873
do you know what is the pride of the english ?	7.854496321310978
do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishman’s mouth ?	85.70065211808136
the seas’ ruler .	1.3945350514397867
his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words , unhating .	605.0829234106155
that on his empire , stephen said , the sun never sets .	18.176840309756432
ba !	1
mr deasy cried .	1.4435175517813021
that’s not english .	1.4435177968002333
a french celt said that .	2.8950005437440502
he tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail .	5.319932766011266
i will tell you , he said solemnly , what is his proudest boast .	20.264128286278538
i paid my way .	1.303029604683565
good man , good man .	2.649100345643072
i paid my way .	1.303029604683565
i never borrowed a shilling in my life .	7.323324729932858
can you feel that ?	2.013726032366004
i owe nothing .	1.4435175867935908
can you ?	1
mulligan , nine pounds , three pairs of socks , one pair brogues , ties .	90.23129496457642

the lump i have is useless .	4.0930881807907165
for the moment , no , stephen answered .	4.9501019979263665
mr deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox .	21.750094615318087
i knew you couldn’t , he said joyously .	5.955749334150663
but one day you must feel it .	5.797360700832576
we are a generous people but we must also be just .	20.151634654746992
i fear those big words , stephen said , which make us so unhappy .	41.818315388952264
mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs albert edward , prince of wales .	2132.6107757721165
you think me an old fogey and an old tory , his thoughtful voice said .	83.24017408302245
i saw three generations since o’connell’s time .	5.7774327768966565
i remember the famine in ’46 .	3.771696779334179
do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before o’connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue ?	11790.246812843909
you fenians forget some things .	2.888693054575606
glorious , pious and immortal memory .	4.125460162559904
the lodge of diamond in armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes .	43.80077136323386
hoarse , masked and armed , the planters’ covenant .	12.01525342378404
the black north and true blue bible .	5.835080638322327
croppies lie down .	1.4412019037366408
stephen sketched a brief gesture .	2.887180357237217
i have rebel blood in me too , mr deasy said .	15.14424991756145
on the spindle side .	2.041759146429213
but i am descended from sir john blackwood who voted for the union .	47.007136618460905
we are all irish , all kings’ sons .	6.591303553698171
alas , stephen said .	2.044066670304306
per vias rectas mr deasy said firmly , was his motto .	17.629615317287687
he voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to dublin from the ards of down to do so .	471.72434909191725
lal the ral the ra the rocky road to dublin .	11.994132536765065
a gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots .	8.228650077221383

that reminds me , mr deasy said .	3.7605447872027273
you can do me a favour , mr dedalus , with some of your literary friends .	70.9719115256781
i have a letter here for the press .	5.896321900192332
sit down a moment .	2.0382310502463694
i have just to copy the end .	5.200692975529287
he went to the desk near the window , pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter .	4926.994281960361
sit down .	1
excuse me , he said over his shoulder , the dictates of common sense .	28.11407485009404
just a moment .	1.426890868262246
he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and , muttering , began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly , sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error .	391827.52420730656
stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence .	8.265389250200245
framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage , their meek heads poised in air lord hastings’ repulse the duke of westminster’s shotover the duke of beaufort’s ceylon prix de paris 1866 .	71353.40971803368
elfin riders sat them , watchful of a sign .	11.951263309547002
he saw their speeds , backing king’s colours , and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds .	198.5577786109771
full stop , mr deasy bade his keys .	6.130599356044811
but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question.. .	5.837876239485216
where cranly led me to get rich quick , hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes , amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen , over the motley slush .	72257.39614824396
even money fair rebel .	2.0414672230950646
ten to one the field .	2.916276906381645
dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs , the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman , a butcher’s dame , nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange .	22676.902174237282
shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle .	22.997730333546166
again a goal .	1.443517520001659
i am among them , among their battling bodies in a medley , the joust of life .	163.44926299982106
you mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick ?	24.9689114156505
jousts .	1
time shocked rebounds , shock by shock .	5.89013375477421
jousts , slush and uproar of battles , the frozen deathspew of the slain , a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts .	2138.692260748051
now then , mr deasy said , rising .	4.37856665032926
he came to the table , pinning together his sheets .	9.623334752026155
stephen stood up .	1.3755895170992718
i have put the matter into a nutshell , mr deasy said .	25.748708915693157
it’s about the foot and mouth disease .	3.845181772781134
just look through it .	2.047395989062066
there can be no two opinions on the matter .	10.210090955580453
may i trespass on your valuable space .	5.04392564514641
that doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history .	23.319350742905595

i don’t mince words , do i ?	5.791108433699517
mr deasy asked as stephen read on .	5.057513229204119

thanking you for the hospitality of your columns .	7.090757482435493
i want that to be printed and read , mr deasy said .	20.16507843926697
you will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on irish cattle .	73.25691181358343
and it can be cured .	2.8895505581693657
it is cured .	1.4435177082283914
my cousin , blackwood price , writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in austria by cattledoctors there .	504.1846166808736
they offer to come over here .	4.089895564723078

i am surrounded by difficulties , by.. .	5.889956377464055

backstairs influence by.. .	1.443517520001659
he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke .	41.29509896629975
mark my words , mr dedalus , he said .	6.513168772493083
england is in the hands of the jews .	5.022228697712749
in all the highest places her finance , her press .	13.316191741380925
and they are the signs of a nation’s decay .	10.693643038248764
wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength .	16.56957425099638
i have seen it coming these years .	5.794065576874218
as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction .	160.12396636691366
old england is dying .	2.0416122381284185
he stepped swiftly off , his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam .	144.13151843502996
he faced about and back again .	3.0030751963978357
dying , he said again , if not dead by now .	13.352448038901514
the harlot’s cry from street to street shall weave old england’s windingsheet .	32.99903795567556
his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted .	82.80316903945868
a merchant , stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ?	618.4743546196949
they sinned against the light , mr deasy said gravely .	7.927693241875689
and you can see the darkness in their eyes .	10.806359013798046
and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day .	31.488018480655693
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers .	165.0198361477877
gabble of geese .	1.443517573782331
they swarmed loud , uncouth about the temple , their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats .	137.34771954994523
not theirs these clothes , this speech , these gestures .	16.938777744315676
their full slow eyes belied the words , the gestures eager and unoffending , but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain .	5592.9433534935915
vain patience to heap and hoard .	4.125045282734362
time surely would scatter all .	2.891781324391634
a hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on .	15.371089985347476
their eyes knew their years of wandering and , patient , knew the dishonours of their flesh .	200.29354697922267
who has not ?	1.2029415656625477
stephen said .	1
what do you mean ?	1.7064598062661198
mr deasy asked .	1.4247310023428275
he came forward a pace and stood by the table .	11.235658287423119
his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly .	4.084012140829221
is this old wisdom ?	2.007314202885355
he waits to hear from me .	3.7556177941788977
history , stephen said , is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake .	34.76740491328136
from the playfield the boys raised a shout .	7.370946712349799
a whirring whistle goal .	1.8720983245430276
what if that nightmare gave you a back kick ?	11.45828802231374
the ways of the creator are not our ways , mr deasy said .	26.310110911700068
all human history moves towards one great goal , the manifestation of god .	45.90326758120231
stephen jerked his thumb towards the window , saying	6.163759133187833
that is god .	1.4435175452525002
hooray !	1
ay !	1
whrrwhee !	1
what ?	1
mr deasy asked .	1.4247310023428275
a shout in the street , stephen answered , shrugging his shoulders .	22.19643482643458
mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers .	160.93499632582424
looking up again he set them free .	5.798267102727406
i am happier than you are , he said .	8.949696541375618
we have committed many errors and many sins .	8.252531720538478
a woman brought sin into the world .	4.168541791751924
for a woman who was no better than she should be , helen , the runaway wife of menelaus , ten years the greeks made war on troy .	3092.144831621613
a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here , macmurrough’s wife and her leman , o’rourke , prince of breffni .	1382.2755660190123
a woman too brought parnell low .	3.746468989939664
many errors , many failures but not the one sin .	16.568190296723788
i am a struggler now at the end of my days .	10.57499401967042
but i will fight for the right till the end .	15.356283453036543
for ulster will fight and ulster will be right .	11.687416203040799
stephen raised the sheets in his hand .	4.932596069270083
well , sir , he began .	2.8129507160787095
i foresee , mr deasy said , that you will not remain here very long at this work .	98.23209919813043
you were not born to be a teacher , i think .	17.07472334437891
perhaps i am wrong .	1.8722478419462925
a learner rather , stephen said .	4.1626622151148975
and here what will you learn more ?	4.951637444584801
mr deasy shook his head .	2.445231167418126
who knows ?	1
he said .	1
to learn one must be humble .	4.087307955786326
but life is the great teacher .	4.130164417575593
stephen rustled the sheets again .	2.7904380633379966
as regards these , he began .	3.793739443403392
yes , mr deasy said .	1.6549060018545743
you have two copies there .	2.8898927526365608
if you can have them published at once .	6.7464637398715785
telegraph .	1
irish homestead .	1
i will try , stephen said , and let you know tomorrow .	20.666769816251318
i know two editors slightly .	2.887183391554768
that will do , mr deasy said briskly .	4.7853656340767845
i wrote last night to mr field , m.p. there is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the city arms hotel .	1015.3738308684273
i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting .	13.512956953785169
you see if you can get it into your two papers .	13.399257437391213
what are they ?	1.4181285421337366
the evening telegraph.. .	1.4435178964393902
that will do , mr deasy said .	4.4861358480265485
there is no time to lose .	3.1010451546825286
now i have to answer that letter from my cousin .	13.8984609219087
good morning , sir , stephen said , putting the sheets in his pocket .	32.01276340971851
thank you .	1
not at all , mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk .	44.38193559525229
i like to break a lance with you , old as i am .	31.875631902800365
good morning , sir , stephen said again , bowing to his bent back .	36.85295289250549
he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield .	2805.3623337224976
the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors .	62.838044590165495
still i will help him in his fight .	7.1992842888405635
mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard .	16.639647742727202
mr dedalus !	1
running after me .	1.4427448685218411
no more letters , i hope .	4.1590216736917025
just one moment .	1.4412019869825854
yes , sir , stephen said , turning back at the gate .	17.698730832373265

they waded a little way in the water and , stooping , soused their bags and , lifting them again , waded out .	1015.3869890385679
the dog yelped running to them , reared up and pawed them , dropping on all fours , again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning .	4219.56043572213
unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand , a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws .	1016.397823207416
his speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop .	82.92078080455893
the carcass lay on his path .	3.7668840799881766
he stopped , sniffed , stalked round it , brother , nosing closer , went round it , sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell .	9683.074846709402

he slunk back in a curve .	3.3975558232088288

along by the edge of the mole he lolloped , dawdled , smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it .	1419.6033015361531

something he buried there , his grandmother .	5.417733111622897
he rooted in the sand , dabbling , delving and stopped to listen to the air , scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws , soon ceasing , a pard , a panther , got in spousebreach , vulturing the dead .	1726761.0190934483

he turned his face over a shoulder , rere regardant .	15.371171125880382

mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls .	32.58058625587901
he liked thick giblet soup , nutty gizzards , a stuffed roast heart , liverslices fried with crustcrumbs , fried hencods’ roes .	966.149545551012
most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine .	539.2010725667619
kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly , righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray .	641.5299790173805
gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere .	102.38077006405523
made him feel a bit peckish .	4.109060586540807
the coals were reddening .	2.041454802256754
another slice of bread and butter three , four right .	11.600095892460105
she didn’t like her plate full .	3.811933187647677
right .	1
he turned from the tray , lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire .	235.68669084110297
it sat there , dull and squat , its spout stuck out .	31.311599877981312
cup of tea soon .	1.776055986897926

mouth dry .	1
the cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high .	48.000304114009985
mkgnao !	1
o , there you are , mr bloom said , turning from the fire .	25.549837555287333
the cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table , mewing .	102.02870541965027
just how she stalks over my writingtable .	5.785557626261824
prr .	1
scratch my head .	1.443517578824203
prr .	1
mr bloom watched curiously , kindly the lithe black form .	15.429467369293725
clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide , the white button under the butt of her tail , the green flashing eyes .	1177.099004540545
he bent down to her , his hands on his knees .	10.671436402564405
milk for the pussens , he said .	5.783173530475609
mrkgnao !	1
the cat cried .	1.4435175517813021
they call them stupid .	1.7756971839410385
they understand what we say better than we understand them .	16.37946860030301
she understands all she wants to .	4.113396755429273
vindictive too .	1

curious mice never squeal .	2.0414471159606205

wonder what i look like to her .	5.830059660099941
height of a tower ?	1.8409021461859412
no , she can jump me .	3.5581800988288808
afraid of the chickens she is , he said mockingly .	8.72874881221027
afraid of the chookchooks .	1.6767808801745008
i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens .	15.280761998184081
mrkrgnao !	1
the cat said loudly .	2.041575107300768
she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes , mewing plaintively and long , showing him her milkwhite teeth .	371.7331939275164
he watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones .	52.60535613276408
then he went to the dresser , took the jug hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him , poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor .	10866.12664850117
gurrhr !	1
she cried , running to lap .	3.0767071080464894
he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly .	247.5728650747345
wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after .	30.13317367047529
why ?	1
they shine in the dark , perhaps , the tips .	14.217622638157764
or kind of feelers in the dark , perhaps .	10.86428285746602
he listened to her licking lap .	4.094446401870465
ham and eggs , no .	2.6891372407677414
no good eggs with this drouth .	4.102859676328775
want pure fresh water .	2.0418490087090286
thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckley’s .	33.069744448360815
fried with butter , a shake of pepper .	7.742393442015005
better a pork kidney at dlugacz’s .	3.766180942627856
while the kettle is boiling .	2.6509137433052805
she lapped slower , then licking the saucer clean .	11.901742174349295
why are their tongues so rough ?	4.017715971401725
to lap better , all porous holes .	5.887155050321828
nothing she can eat ?	2.007378303106588
he glanced round him .	2.0430453213178508
no .	1
on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall , paused by the bedroom door .	197.67251606155745
she might like something tasty .	2.6492859827017963
thin bread and butter she likes in the morning .	9.716124260930576
still perhaps once in a way .	3.8251252528202047
he said softly in the bare hall	3.426362510655642
i’m going round the corner .	2.8396085352375855
be back in a minute .	2.1103117113266276
and when he had heard his voice say it he added	10.493614357990012
you don’t want anything for breakfast ?	3.694463481980787
a sleepy soft grunt answered	2.000259645274419
mn .	1
no .	1
she didn’t want anything .	2.0417064841752635
he heard then a warm heavy sigh , softer , as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled .	1132.7174801719264
must get those settled really .	2.6479003848927145
pity .	1
all the way from gibraltar .	2.44643903542038

i rose from the ranks , sir , and i’m proud of it .	27.58097187807591
still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps .	21.555784239524577
now that was farseeing .	2.041445023505124
his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof .	405.3851334414817
stamps stickyback pictures .	1.4435177270501993
daresay lots of officers are in the swim too .	10.807730307481245
course they do .	1.441901461237632
the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely plasto’s high grade ha .	80.2884863683462
he peeped quickly inside the leather headband .	5.545723659231334
white slip of paper .	1.8602054734186388
quite safe .	1
on the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey .	24.56335648413307
not there .	1
in the trousers i left off .	4.093133034053676

creaky wardrobe .	1
no use disturbing her .	2.047131830879208

she said .	1
she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow .	113.63203959217206
he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs , sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder .	1096.8001336641437
the warmth of her couched body rose on the air , mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured .	389.50258008178827
a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow .	18.04912461084563
in the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread .	17.91042546325515

he cried suddenly .	1.4435177137642337
he fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and , stubbing his toes against the broken commode , hurried out towards the smell , stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs .	73370.88900052954
pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan .	48.39105345803918
by prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back .	553.669869660809
only a little burnt .	2.0414689500294814
he tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it .	299.94604482538284
cup of tea now .	1.7804855504778454
he sat down , cut and buttered a slice of the loaf .	30.822676094835035
he shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat .	27.497978319733228
then he put a forkful into his mouth , chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat .	104.98030253328105
done to a turn .	1.7764553259205187
a mouthful of tea .	2.0404893499803536
then he cut away dies of bread , sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth .	161.5798848271372
what was that about some young student and a picnic ?	13.77329889481873

i would notice that from remembering .	4.106009339253689

greyish over the ears .	2.0415933757188327
madame smiling .	1
i smiled back .	1.443517500750311

nice fellow .	1
who knows is that true about the woman he keeps ?	16.365278042774893
not pleasant for the wife .	2.8835228640901356
yet they say , who was it told me , there is no carnal .	31.230086269590387
you would imagine that would get played out pretty quick .	16.433293930246222

martin cunningham nudged mr power .	2.8828014830974356
of the tribe of reuben , he said .	4.660553502693311
a tall blackbearded figure , bent on a stick , stumping round the corner of elvery’s elephant house , showed them a curved hand open on his spine .	5061.2388188270115
in all his pristine beauty , mr power said .	8.288662781011174
mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly	11.582529287528953
the devil break the hasp of your back !	8.215688138944229
mr power , collapsing in laughter , shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed gray’s statue .	286.7294034017642
we have all been there , martin cunningham said broadly .	9.009329617960006
his eyes met mr bloom’s eyes .	4.088134847253876
he caressed his beard , adding	2.63639235140705
well , nearly all of us .	3.763975736747334
mr bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces .	29.270635765321146
that’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about reuben j and the son .	78.60873692045122

mr power asked .	1.3581066670605706

isn’t it awfully good ?	1.7950337737257955
what is that ?	1.441122529075467
mr dedalus asked .	1.256577396872272
i didn’t hear it .	2.0453394725939607
there was a girl in the case , mr bloom began , and he determined to send him to the isle of man out of harm’s way but when they were both.... .	4469.8692774929605

mr dedalus asked .	1.256577396872272

mr dedalus cried .	1.309656609741981
i wish to christ he did !	4.024225411566906
mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils .	16.52930723178703
no , mr bloom said , the son himself.... .	4.410514940665174
martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely	2.8411712677466396
reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the liffey .	144794.8634556641
for god’s sake !	1.418770691228592
mr dedalus exclaimed in fright .	2.9083457106640394
is he dead ?	1.419319900088655
dead !	1
martin cunningham cried .	1.4435175517813021

a boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive .	6877.559591391482
half the town was there .	2.8947093257831615
yes , mr bloom said .	1.9595627065677859
but the funny part is.... .	2.8873266619502376
and reuben j , martin cunningham said , gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life .	181.29218293817925
a stifled sigh came from under mr power’s hand .	11.592640835992892
o , he did , martin cunningham affirmed .	4.6622843241249665
like a hero .	1.4412021047953736
a silver florin .	1.443517783514679
isn’t it awfully good ?	1.7950337737257955
mr bloom said eagerly .	1.4703376776485186
one and eightpence too much , mr dedalus said drily .	6.2101205093695215
mr power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage .	10.78655649453061
nelson’s pillar .	1
eight plums a penny !	2.005137184271434

mr dedalus sighed .	1.3945346689923508
ah then indeed , he said , poor little paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh .	60.23723083064963
many a good one he told himself .	4.40697114601663
the lord forgive me !	2.008931952903165
mr power said , wiping his wet eyes with his fingers .	16.994354976354344
poor paddy !	1
i little thought a week ago when i saw him last and he was in his usual health that i’d be driving after him like this .	1671.5209188006236
he’s gone from us .	2.0388909749467077
as decent a little man as ever wore a hat , mr dedalus said .	51.79649162305614
he went very suddenly .	2.0416708602560054
breakdown , martin cunningham said .	2.350386574492881

he tapped his chest sadly .	2.647624434361788

too much john barleycorn .	2.0414457608920857
cure for a red nose .	2.6267229041604634
drink like the devil till it turns adelite .	8.192359205608494
a lot of money he spent colouring it .	6.336286264647993
mr power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension .	14.450600821836883
he had a sudden death , poor fellow , he said .	15.987773234146543

poor little thing , mr dedalus said .	4.939052624982496
it’s well out of it .	2.526002995754354

but the worst of all , mr power said , is the man who takes his own life .	91.64659796656628
martin cunningham drew out his watch briskly , coughed and put it back .	38.82879819533763
the greatest disgrace to have in the family , mr power added .	22.53739170442153
temporary insanity , of course , martin cunningham said decisively .	8.157592933865415
we must take a charitable view of it .	8.310478371459675
they say a man who does it is a coward , mr dedalus said .	40.857220181554425

the carriage rattled swiftly along blessington street .	5.77843025749121
over the stones .	1.3143018228842362
we are going the pace , i think , martin cunningham said .	19.231283748860157

he’s gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me .	11.945740103324738
from one extreme to the other .	3.9900814701491947
the carriage galloped round a corner stopped .	5.814354763447089
what’s wrong now ?	1.4193192188109869
a divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows , lowing , slouching by on padded hoofs , whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups .	5902.640407830059
outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear .	23.167083120903566

the carriage moved on through the drove .	5.096658450108101
i can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays , mr bloom said .	544.6188052309627
all those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats .	26.20762126709821
instead of blocking up the thoroughfare , martin cunningham said .	13.714147413953874
quite right .	1
they ought to .	1.2467836803455483
yes , mr bloom said , and another thing i often thought , is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in milan , you know .	2233.9289438607475
run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams , hearse and carriage and all .	235.30715476641856

why ?	1
mr bloom asked , turning to mr dedalus .	6.108815005780759
wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast ?	10.434556611929354
well , there’s something in that , mr dedalus granted .	11.73292900857398
and , martin cunningham said , we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road .	2014.2845440735368
that was terrible , mr power’s shocked face said , and the corpse fell about the road .	116.01118606497315

mouth fallen open .	1.44351764628209
asking what’s up now .	2.043031120503023
quite right to close it .	2.8956297054726727
looks horrid open .	1.44351764628209
then the insides decompose quickly .	2.887511127235149
much better to close up all the orifices .	6.684205868331135
yes , also .	1.443517696085206
with wax .	1

but suppose now it did happen .	4.096353325067212
would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about ?	36.246508359920995
he would and he wouldn’t , i suppose .	7.439149093275399
depends on where .	1.4435175428455478
the circulation stops .	1.4435176141169919
still some might ooze out of an artery .	7.582463613274245
it would be better to bury them in red a dark red .	28.777631935532384
in silence they drove along phibsborough road .	5.296934545515884
an empty hearse trotted by , coming from the cemetery looks relieved .	29.017331394588396
crossguns bridge the royal canal .	2.8510738460675635
water rushed roaring through the sluices .	4.1329857128115535

on the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse .	11.782949375989768
aboard of the bugabu .	2.0414455901568367
their eyes watched him .	2.0456539311032853
on the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds , over slime , mudchoked bottles , carrion dogs .	36451.52918793248
athlone , mullingar , moyvalley , i could make a walking tour to see milly by the canal .	242.41301604568613

martin cunningham said .	1.380456666853818

or so they said .	1.8742665092165367
the crown had no evidence , mr power said .	9.535125036420053
only circumstantial , martin cunningham added .	2.944854918317228
that’s the maxim of the law .	4.176989209245628
better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned .	93.88358540198944
they looked .	1

she mightn’t like me to come that way without letting her know .	30.4418484663868
must be careful about women .	2.890236719571587

the barrow turned into a side lane .	5.815411422325073
a portly man , ambushed among the grasses , raised his hat in homage .	54.02178813860847

my dear simon , the caretaker answered in a low voice .	22.29862698750935
i don’t want your custom at all .	4.680979577139063
saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back .	437.9387299366719
did you hear that one , he asked them , about mulcahy from the coombe ?	50.09460221792771
i did not , martin cunningham said .	3.960920481959033
they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear .	33.36957192277608
the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles .	1120.8780092716504
they tell the story , he said , that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs .	2701.217464865863
they asked for mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried .	48.195721409958026
after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough .	28.407238835507673
one of the drunks spelt out the name terence mulcahy .	12.340706733286847
the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up .	235.3164340416758

and , after blinking up at the sacred figure , not a bloody bit like the man says he .	199.6532849872291
that’s not mulcahy says he , whoever done it .	8.66643867338963
rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher , accepting the dockets given him , turning them over and scanning them as he walked .	5902.609647346404
that’s all done with a purpose , martin cunningham explained to hynes .	24.729749532441833

one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass .	33.68003376844098
one , leaving his mates , walked slowly on with shouldered weapon , its blade blueglancing .	137.09995744889332

like that , mr bloom said , crossing his forefingers at the top .	25.01686681292445
let him take that in first .	3.493414767191
mr bloom , glancing sideways up from the cross he had made , saw the foreman’s sallow face , think he has a touch of jaundice , and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper .	115398.87603283298

do you think that’s a good idea ?	3.361395958097849
the foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly .	45.65769352967365

a recently discovered fragment of cicero , professor machugh answered with pomp of tone .	52.54743418752226

j. j. o’molloy asked , looking towards the inner door .	10.294297534541666

he took off his silk hat and , blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache , welshcombed his hair with raking fingers .	666.7849616193375
ned lambert tossed the newspaper aside , chuckling with delight .	16.847873582236854

the bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked	19.926262125915148

and here comes the sham squire himself !	5.744372106904791

ned lambert sidled down from the table .	4.913838579914276
the editor’s blue eyes roved towards mr bloom’s face , shadowed by a smile .	67.199290623916

the editor shouted .	1.4435177552826162
so it was , begad , ned lambert agreed .	7.427015131520515
passing out he whispered to j. j. o’molloy	4.767325525857114

the professor said .	1.4379329319647358
long , short and long .	2.9178814088677836
o , harp eolian !	2.0064526413497226
he took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and , breaking off a piece , twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth .	10944.56608186764
bingbang , bangbang .	1.4435178964393902
mr bloom , seeing the coast clear , made for the inner door .	27.66141224780666
just a moment , mr crawford , he said .	9.22508408781432
i just want to phone about an ad .	8.230065772044012
he went in .	1.3945320226644273
what about that leader this evening ?	3.378670672889625
professor machugh asked , coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder .	83.47960866578663
that’ll be all right , myles crawford said more calmly .	7.608153096162132
never you fret .	1.4435178964393902
hello , jack .	1.4270173345183745
that’s all right .	1.3015718743706324
good day , myles , j. j. o’molloy said , letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file .	352.9196478509388
is that canada swindle case on today ?	4.98796774815483
the telephone whirred inside .	1.8724910014408165

lenehan came out of the inner office with sport ’s tissues .	13.736588641082733
who wants a dead cert for the gold cup ?	10.381405065884085
he asked .	1
sceptre with o. madden up .	2.4887247523640292
he tossed the tissues on to the table .	8.194810686642205
screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open .	76.82926952174589
hush , lenehan said .	1.9096983252451112
i hear feetstoops .	1.4435178964393902
professor machugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps .	2418.616840879377
the tissues rustled up in the draught , floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth .	535.1052518135567
it wasn’t me , sir .	2.8237696225762985
it was the big fellow shoved me , sir .	7.617753488911187
throw him out and shut the door , the editor said .	20.39453433977029
there’s a hurricane blowing .	2.041526572734535
lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor , grunting as he stooped twice .	108.98376763969982
waiting for the racing special , sir , the newsboy said .	15.40968404195495
it was pat farrell shoved me , sir .	7.564942937495462
he pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe .	15.268250434262605
him , sir .	1.4382673600252849
out of this with you , professor machugh said gruffly .	8.820093047995211
he hustled the boy out and banged the door to .	16.234485742547296
j. j. o’molloy turned the files crackingly over , murmuring , seeking	15.183063689443854
continued on page six , column four .	5.878960177247174
yes , evening telegraph here , mr bloom phoned from the inner office .	25.361428773583633
is the boss... ?	1.4193212175477754
yes , telegraph .. .	2.041614739483008
to where ?	1
aha !	1

aha !	1
i see.. .	1
right .	1
i’ll catch him .	1.4421165949048869
a collision ensues	1
the bell whirred again as he rang off .	7.530543531514924
he came in quickly and bumped against lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue .	117.20188064279395
pardon , monsieur lenehan said , clutching him for an instant and making a grimace .	61.96305861068218
my fault , mr bloom said , suffering his grip .	8.610611865821301
are you hurt ?	1.4182794848389337
i’m in a hurry .	1.90933988131338
knee , lenehan said .	1.9096983252451112
he made a comic face and whined , rubbing his knee	14.381697026826368
the accumulation of the anno domini .	4.130824301748598
sorry , mr bloom said .	2.259822265616616
he went to the door and , holding it ajar , paused .	23.516150175513264
j. j. o’molloy slapped the heavy pages over .	6.026695613063952
the noise of two shrill voices , a mouthorgan , echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps	633.1269037257827
we are the boys of wexford who fought with heart and hand .	32.145347362987664
exit bloom	1
i’m just running round to bachelor’s walk , mr bloom said , about this ad of keyes’s .	99.78389424330706
want to fix it up .	2.8938413349715035
they tell me he’s round there in dillon’s .	8.239375739410576
he looked indecisively for a moment at their faces .	10.323556563108081
the editor who , leaning against the mantelshelf , had propped his head on his hand , suddenly stretched forth an arm amply .	1118.401234642637
begone !	1
he said .	1
the world is before you .	2.65361375936784
back in no time , mr bloom said , hurrying out .	14.665587015961039
j. j. o’molloy took the tissues from lenehan’s hand and read them , blowing them apart gently , without comment .	409.6428461979179
he’ll get that advertisement , the professor said , staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind .	107.05593287050996
look at the young scamps after him .	4.934969289786587
show .	1
where ?	1
lenehan cried , running to the window .	4.750361261349017
a street cortège	1
both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in mr bloom’s wake , the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite , a tail of white bowknots .	23475.655581187562
look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry , lenehan said , and you’ll kick .	107.60611776191702
o , my rib risible !	2.290605399246475
taking off his flat spaugs and the walk .	8.334588509161275
small nines .	1
steal upon larks .	1.4435178964393902
he began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to j. j. o’molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands .	4481.633949674615
what’s that ?	1
myles crawford said with a start .	2.4758742908562192
where are the other two gone ?	3.3815765635523456
who ?	1
the professor said , turning .	2.2169979471500336
they’re gone round to the oval for a drink .	7.359034333985113
paddy hooper is there with jack hall .	5.803972982392904
came over last night .	2.0390046008973117
come on then , myles crawford said .	4.775069397747689
where’s my hat ?	1.3101702766944727
he walked jerkily into the office behind , parting the vent of his jacket , jingling his keys in his back pocket .	987.9723197292052
they jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer .	92.55344670110617
he’s pretty well on , professor machugh said in a low voice .	21.29583245799488
seems to be , j. j. o’molloy said , taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation , but it is not always as it seems .	847.9078965473575
who has the most matches ?	2.604684931462647
the calumet of peace	1.4142566492431092
he offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself .	23.720337855400015
lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn .	44.15669465950649
j. j. o’molloy opened his case again and offered it .	11.021861358345012
thanky vous lenehan said , helping himself .	4.8153966565101145
the editor came from the inner office , a straw hat awry on his brow .	63.55015280308327
he declaimed in song , pointing sternly at professor machugh	11.54252858767026
’twas rank and fame that tempted thee , ’twas empire charmed thy heart .	33.49445873193405
the professor grinned , locking his long lips .	8.248287230053387
eh ?	1
you bloody old roman empire ?	2.603429564909525
myles crawford said .	1.4382869433863184
he took a cigarette from the open case .	5.691885831859051
lenehan , lighting it for him with quick grace , said	15.119429310933949
silence for my brandnew riddle !	2.8376377304233666
imperium romanum j. j. o’molloy said gently .	4.449492063066622
it sounds nobler than british or brixton .	5.7837583919074715
the word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire .	15.73802581880995
myles crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling .	16.580405722542906
that’s it , he said .	2.37526955539867
we are the fat .	1.5859078284755712
you and i are the fat in the fire .	9.020940183894144
we haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell .	16.89658172476674
the grandeur that was rome	2.0041258800553923
wait a moment , professor machugh said , raising two quiet claws .	16.805353428297384
we mustn’t be led away by words , by sounds of words .	30.941143285570302
we think of rome , imperial , imperious , imperative .	17.206121400175807
he extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs , pausing	11.541705298456296
what was their civilisation ?	2.007239587201763
vast , i allow but vile .	4.086705343764573
cloacae sewers .	1
the jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said it is meet to be here .	67.5957725580997
let us build an altar to jehovah .	5.8126433975728204
the roman , like the englishman who follows in his footsteps , brought to every new shore on which he set his foot ( on our shore he never set it ) only his cloacal obsession .	125722.61882298386
he gazed about him in his toga and he said it is meet to be here .	63.333554840797994
let us construct a watercloset .	2.905154186805622
which they accordingly did do , lenehan said .	7.782625744205776
our old ancient ancestors , as we read in the first chapter of guinness’s , were partial to the running stream .	642.7069937558506
they were nature’s gentlemen , j. j. o’molloy murmured .	6.382731479256082
but we have also roman law .	3.7458237787183353
and pontius pilate is its prophet , professor machugh responded .	12.843533798656226
do you know that story about chief baron palles ?	8.944858045202526
j. j. o’molloy asked .	1.5866027222798913
it was at the royal university dinner .	4.911858455346699
everything was going swimmingly .. .	2.8872838589594614
first my riddle , lenehan said .	3.8883280892373087
are you ready ?	1.4193193047799462
mr o’madden burke , tall in copious grey of donegal tweed , came in from the hallway .	116.79056352243428

sufficient for the day...	1.296845216440266
j. j. o’molloy , smiling palely , took up the gage .	16.716559934714642
my dear myles , he said , flinging his cigarette aside , you put a false construction on my words .	392.72658307081036
i hold no brief , as at present advised , for the third profession qua profession but your cork legs are running away with you .	2580.8314892223398
why not bring in henry grattan and flood and demosthenes and edmund burke ?	44.149343510127466
ignatius gallaher we all know and his chapelizod boss , harmsworth of the farthing press , and his american cousin of the bowery guttersheet not to mention paddy kelly’s budget pue’s occurrences and our watchful friend the skibbereen eagle .	347266.4928863343
why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like whiteside ?	16.34542459197976
sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof .	6.64182440650574
links with bygone days of yore	2.858067440329129
grattan and flood wrote for this very paper , the editor cried in his face .	65.79077506400982

bushe ?	1
the editor said .	1.4420348125203253
well , yes bushe , yes .	4.142878789227897
he has a strain of it in his blood .	6.679017054680863
kendal bushe or i mean seymour bushe .	5.023177009207462
he would have been on the bench long ago , the professor said , only for ... .	71.51987393564184
but no matter .	1.4435176454878955
j. j. o’molloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly	10.221788754896558
one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe .	537.4057964702396
it was in that case of fratricide , the childs murder case .	20.787500555231812
bushe defended him .	1.443517467089795
and in the porches of mine ear did pour .	9.156127034534215
by the way how did he find that out ?	8.099747321052432
he died in his sleep .	2.6331151601956053
or the other story , beast with two backs ?	9.324234326991887
what was that ?	1.2072039737025804
the professor asked .	1.3129661609942482
italia , magistra artium	1.41421803228721
he spoke on the law of evidence , j. j. o’molloy said , of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code , the lex talionis .	3087.1548585906166
and he cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican .	17.014738093403288
ha .	1
a few wellchosen words , lenehan prefaced .	5.319532067183099
silence !	1
pause .	1
j. j. o’molloy took out his cigarettecase .	3.6414957539094535
false lull .	1
something quite ordinary .	1.4435178964393902
messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar .	14.470415644704488
i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act , trivial in itself , that striking of that match , that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives .	176596.13843228391
a polished period	1
j. j. o’molloy resumed , moulding his words	4.214878450092433
he said of it that stony effigy in frozen music , horned and terrible , of the human form divine , that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which , if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live , deserves to live .	55355624.4938724
his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall .	16.674497988568618
fine !	1
myles crawford said at once .	2.1739986093180295
the divine afflatus , mr o’madden burke said .	6.039047185009979
you like it ?	1.3084750591327765
j. j. o’molloy asked stephen .	2.0724306864221202
stephen , his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture , blushed .	36.99631305269956
he took a cigarette from the case .	4.618650299079508
j. j. o’molloy offered his case to myles crawford .	7.748646084074176
lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy , saying	19.758318336844315
muchibus thankibus .	1
a man of high morale	1.5780462258807697
professor magennis was speaking to me about you , j. j. o’molloy said to stephen .	47.13500074175991
what do you think really of that hermetic crowd , the opal hush poets a. e. the mastermystic ?	202.82102119399255
that blavatsky woman started it .	2.895569825910039
she was a nice old bag of tricks .	5.479217272629592
a. e. has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness .	2641.8863568501656
magennis thinks you must have been pulling a. e.’s leg .	13.103419964059682
he is a man of the very highest morale , magennis .	13.853071735193785
speaking about me .	1.4435174719621082
what did he say ?	2.061184478042328
what did he say ?	2.061184478042328
what did he say about me ?	3.547914448859313
don’t ask .	1
no , thanks , professor machugh said , waving the cigarettecase aside .	29.12408578670624
wait a moment .	1.358305006656949
let me say one thing .	2.8894083490440625
the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society .	617.8442778193344
mr justice fitzgibbon , the present lord justice of appeal , had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay ( new for those days ), advocating the revival of the irish tongue .	56450.379406317974
he turned towards myles crawford and said	3.7004586863830053
you know gerald fitzgibbon .	2.041462609445159
then you can imagine the style of his discourse .	10.944554290574853
he is sitting with tim healy , j. j. o’molloy said , rumour has it , on the trinity college estates commission .	362.8224817317434
he is sitting with a sweet thing , myles crawford said , in a child’s frock .	63.957632673123825
go on .	1
well ?	1
it was the speech , mark you , the professor said , of a finished orator , full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement .	1267221.3147160334
it was then a new movement .	3.3320519364559713
we were weak , therefore worthless .	4.156045401217016
he closed his long thin lips an instant but , eager to be on , raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and , with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims , steadied them to a new focus .	536485.3608623899
impromptu	1
in ferial tone he addressed j. j. o’molloy	5.675202607035652
taylor had come there , you must know , from a sickbed .	25.0917665269339
that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall .	250.7458799598392
his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it .	33.30507915673541
he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked ( though he was not ) a dying man .	373.6451709232981
his gaze turned at once but slowly from j. j. o’molloy’s towards stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground , seeking .	1305.030769933572
his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head , soiled by his withering hair .	87.94653407493023
still seeking , he said	2.0070373613560215
when fitzgibbon’s speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply .	21.31821596783664
briefly , as well as i can bring them to mind , his words were these .	87.58759594321397
he raised his head firmly .	2.513912076725447
his eyes bethought themselves once more .	4.086199724749661
witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro , seeking outlet .	38.070333509325884
he began	1
mr chairman , ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend .	4076.7391568348194
it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country , into an age remote from this age , that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses .	11906015.62808073
his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear , their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech .	476.29905265462946
and let our crooked smokes .	2.509391453525766
noble words coming .	1.4435175849092061
look out .	1
could you try your hand at it yourself ?	8.079732029354945
and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride .	1127.9815712964512
i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me .	21.27926700464671
from the fathers	1
it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted .	8130.1126112001775
ah , curse you !	2.0103151361510987
that’s saint augustine .	1.4435178964393902
why will you jews not accept our culture , our religion and our language ?	66.22142889747178
you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people .	23.345831248532992
you have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys , trireme and quadrireme , laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe .	42310.81789890874
you have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature , a priesthood , an agelong history and a polity .	665.5363738614014
nile .	1
child , man , effigy .	2.3646081792907783
by the nilebank the babemaries kneel , cradle of bulrushes a man supple in combat stonehorned , stonebearded , heart of stone .	1153.268870071831
you pray to a local and obscure idol our temples , majestic and mysterious , are the abodes of isis and osiris , of horus and ammon ra .	9556.795719060054
yours serfdom , awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas .	21.119311111261954
israel is weak and few are her children egypt is an host and terrible are her arms .	190.3247443396673
vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name .	33.2438713082085
a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech .	8.282752321512728
he lifted his voice above it boldly	3.201999561348054
but , ladies and gentlemen , had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life , had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage , nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day .	103217018.65833023
he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law , graven in the language of the outlaw .	1592446.2531802559
he ceased and looked at them , enjoying a silence .	14.166459581992344
ominous for him !	1.417545547362063
j. j. o’molloy said not without regret	3.1004996884541427
and yet he died without having entered the land of promise .	19.78266758308738
a sudden at the moment though from lingering illness often previously expectorated demise , lenehan added .	134.9037219778834
and with a great future behind him .	4.610133035574714
the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase .	135.41043343784827
that is oratory , the professor said uncontradicted .	5.172450614150186
gone with the wind .	2.0392209060672766
hosts at mullaghmast and tara of the kings .	8.432931844838667

dead noise .	1
akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was .	11.630785986186034
love and laud him me no more .	5.7930632985439585
i have money .	1.4435175854736113
gentlemen , stephen said .	2.044066670304306
as the next motion on the agenda paper may i suggest that the house do now adjourn ?	145.38414658209692
you take my breath away .	2.888571777704071
it is not perchance a french compliment ?	4.692937572255945
mr o’madden burke asked .	1.5465685404017213
’tis the hour , methinks , when the winejug , metaphorically speaking , is most grateful in ye ancient hostelry .	451.03983635334816
that it be and hereby is resolutely resolved .	7.727498294560768
all that are in favour say ay , lenehan announced .	16.754176423850147
the contrary no .	1.4435175982021493
i declare it carried .	2.041526326224639
to which particular boosing shed... ?	2.8386597999144287
my casting vote is mooney’s !	2.8437307561727736
he led the way , admonishing	2.1738991188536314
we will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters , will we not ?	47.108239496556756
yes , we will not .	2.4370722810764747
by no manner of means .	2.670115483314726
mr o’madden burke , following close , said with an ally’s lunge of his umbrella	50.92802376239296
lay on , macduff !	2.0064498452913475
chip of the old block !	2.4332297991824388
the editor cried , clapping stephen on the shoulder .	9.08311331775503
let us go .	1.3945323718365437
where are those blasted keys ?	2.8387959665338913
he fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets .	12.985832334602204
foot and mouth .	1.164828757122967
i know .	1
that’ll be all right .	1.656888852772641

where are they ?	1.4181285421337366
that’s all right .	1.3015718743706324
he thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office .	20.90660472633608
let us hope	1
j. j. o’molloy , about to follow him in , said quietly to stephen	30.630043843795782
i hope you will live to see it published .	9.303611921858183
myles , one moment .	2.038350870982454
he went into the inner office , closing the door behind him .	27.022305411244908
come along , stephen , the professor said .	6.049628444116467
that is fine , isn’t it ?	3.679033816644055

the professor said , skipping to get into step .	8.400057174556464

another newsboy shot past them , yelling as he ran	11.586870431964293

they give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase , grunting , encouraging each other , afraid of the dark , panting , one asking the other have you the brawn , praising god and the blessed virgin , threatening to come down , peeping at the airslits .	120848567.14913072
glory be to god .	1.9308797025190012
they had no idea it was that high .	6.928525719100002

vestal virgins .	1

what’s keeping our friend ?	2.0069589693784216
he turned .	1
a bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps , scattering in all directions , yelling , their white papers fluttering .	535.4677186176846
hard after them myles crawford appeared on the steps , his hat aureoling his scarlet face , talking with j. j. o’molloy .	623.0373842865546

it is the ghost , the king , a king and no king , and the player is shakespeare who has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre .	337827.95319216273
he speaks the words to burbage , the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth , calling him by a name	1581.4298692686614

is it possible that that player shakespeare , a ghost by absence , and in the vesture of buried denmark , a ghost by death , speaking his own words to his own son’s name ( had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been prince hamlet’s twin ), is it possible , i want to know , or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises you are the dispossessed son i am the murdered father your mother is the guilty queen , ann shakespeare , born hathaway ?	10867859349158.416

mr dedalus , your views are most illuminating .	6.418125233789516

i was prepared for paradoxes from what malachi mulligan told us but i may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that shakespeare is hamlet you have a stern task before you .	121233.71318201112

as we , or mother dana , weave and unweave our bodies , stephen said , from day to day , their molecules shuttled to and fro , so does the artist weave and unweave his image .	106652.38278798183
and as the mole on my right breast is where it was when i was born , though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time , so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth .	2703586.8842460094
in the intense instant of imagination , when the mind , shelley says , is a fading coal , that which i was is that which i am and that which in possibility i may come to be .	125443.43621958068
so in the future , the sister of the past , i may see myself as i sit here now but by reflection from that which then i shall be .	10411.6640469118
drummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile .	7.542312926264067
yes , mr best said youngly .	2.5550347619754765
i feel hamlet quite young .	2.888273507825635

that mole is the last to go , stephen said , laughing .	19.57625833973249
john eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow .	5.81108695963006
if that were the birthmark of genius , he said , genius would be a drug in the market .	237.70275803184447
the plays of shakespeare’s later years which renan admired so much breathe another spirit .	65.47988991196053
the spirit of reconciliation , the quaker librarian breathed .	6.993899428892452
there can be no reconciliation , stephen said , if there has not been a sundering .	64.27417480539094
said that .	1
if you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of king lear , othello , hamlet , troilus and cressida look to see when and how the shadow lifts .	143533.17429164157

his own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience , material and moral .	419.8754801587193
such an appeal will touch him .	4.091246498201461
the images of other males of his blood will repel him .	23.50938457274435
he will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself .	95.44879497339484
the benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope .	18.17241084889123
i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public .	81.37849315352653
and we ought to mention another irish commentator , mr george bernard shaw .	36.486541911445315
nor should we forget mr frank harris .	5.77857502641431
his articles on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant .	23.559601557819438
oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets .	176.7764785744482
the favoured rival is william herbert , earl of pembroke .	14.11438769111471
i own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with what shall i say ?	1063.5617920316981
our notions of what ought not to have been .	9.728752999324662
felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them , auk’s egg , prize of their fray .	234.0800710359439
he thous and thees her with grave husbandwords .	8.223171206781855
dost love , miriam ?	2.0072488949797362
dost love thy man ?	2.008417021726494
that may be too , stephen said .	5.582976916577838
there’s a saying of goethe’s which mr magee likes to quote .	23.52325596354003
beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life .	121.86371240946751
why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride , a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood , a lordling to woo for him ?	33409.17872272442
he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet .	516.7212364380592
why ?	1
belief in himself has been untimely killed .	5.77816014207973
he was overborne in a cornfield first ( ryefield , i should say ) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down .	75754.1236121046
assumed dongiovannism will not save him .	4.095306518978219
no later undoing will undo the first undoing .	8.269063427015489
the tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding .	46.932256669120584
if the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon .	46.781126302577185
there is , i feel in the words , some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion , a darker shadow of the first , darkening even his own understanding of himself .	45334.583857958
a like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool .	32.62003094530324
they list .	1
and in the porches of their ears i pour .	9.195683916441928
the soul has been before stricken mortally , a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear .	226.4352601250436
but those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come .	15130.834182169001
the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator .	4752.289740870282
that is why the speech ( his lean unlovely english ) is always turned elsewhere , backward .	158.73669418036002
ravisher and ravished , what he would but would not , go with him from lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to imogen’s breast , bare , with its mole cinquespotted .	11039.52364176994
he goes back , weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself , an old dog licking an old sore .	2600.800999548452
but , because loss is his gain , he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality , untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed .	20008.920861208895
his beaver is up .	2.044408225309197
he is a ghost , a shadow now , the wind by elsinore’s rocks or what you will , the sea’s voice , a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow , the son consubstantial with the father .	1169141.7041850418
amen !	1

hast thou found me , o mine enemy ?	7.505670292356893

a ribald face , sullen as a dean’s , buck mulligan came forward , then blithe in motley , towards the greeting of their smiles .	1877.5225883397986
my telegram .	1
you were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate , if i mistake not ?	28.182761551451126
he asked of stephen .	2.0421141448165088
primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed panama as with a bauble .	33.346723155570324
they make him welcome .	2.038233611727205

he who himself begot middler the holy ghost and himself sent himself , agenbuyer , between himself and others , who , put upon by his fiends , stripped and whipped , was nailed like bat to barndoor , starved on crosstree , who let him bury , stood up , harrowed hell , fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of his own self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already .	36087150896974.44

o , flowers !	1.4187709089719136
bells with bells with bells aquiring .	3.474168485646432
yes , indeed , the quaker librarian said .	5.112226947316109
a most instructive discussion .	2.0414848475209775
mr mulligan , i’ll be bound , has his theory too of the play and of shakespeare .	149.294247605
all sides of life should be represented .	5.781553381814591
he smiled on all sides equally .	3.3013692845466056
buck mulligan thought , puzzled	2.035801034826986
shakespeare ?	1
he said .	1
i seem to know the name .	3.624449004336989
a flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features .	11.68660418266706
to be sure , he said , remembering brightly .	7.412887090380111
the chap that writes like synge .	3.7482345713614333
mr best turned to him .	2.5827898331428343
haines missed you , he said .	3.1579053454370136
did you meet him ?	2.010776176418951
he’ll see you after at the d. b. c. he’s gone to gill’s to buy hyde’s lovesongs of connacht .	238.35688888509097
i came through the museum , buck mulligan said .	9.001585336210928
was he here ?	1.4193192465640272
the bard’s fellowcountrymen , john eglinton answered , are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising .	147.03177099464563
i hear that an actress played hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin .	86.71664533747824
vining held that the prince was a woman .	6.580223615409013
has no-one made him out to be an irishman ?	9.189576304171322
judge barton , i believe , is searching for some clues .	19.37289415720637
he swears ( his highness not his lordship ) by saint patrick .	33.07025284126953
the most brilliant of all is that story of wilde’s , mr best said , lifting his brilliant notebook .	317.4255282601144
that portrait of mr w. h. where he proves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes , a man all hues .	1200.9647319221376
for willie hughes , is it not ?	3.652670216219115
the quaker librarian asked .	1.6626799830677594
or hughie wills ?	1.4193212175477754
mr william himself .	1.4435175705338703
w. h. who am i ?	2.8429380134667337
i mean , for willie hughes , mr best said , amending his gloss easily .	55.024027798817585
of course it’s all paradox , don’t you know , hughes and hews and hues , the colour , but it’s so typical the way he works it out .	6380.0467936911955
it’s the very essence of wilde , don’t you know .	13.352541436747456
the light touch .	1.443517588449564
his glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled , a blond ephebe .	37.46950486297065
tame essence of wilde .	1.9721881375881125
you’re darned witty .	1.4435178023358575
three drams of usquebaugh you drank with dan deasy’s ducats .	16.43269544258876
how much did i spend ?	2.8434090329528487
o , a few shillings .	2.8874173271154047
for a plump of pressmen .	2.9168331637534584

a snake coils her , fang in’s kiss .	8.335779413628488
do you think it is only a paradox ?	5.4832750769836265
the quaker librarian was asking .	2.236171532120791
the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious .	20.223009701268214
they talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness .	4.125036988009368
buck mulligan’s again heavy face eyed stephen awhile .	8.173389414983825
then , his head wagging , he came near , drew a folded telegram from his pocket .	114.94264777188869
his mobile lips read , smiling with new delight .	11.803574087390148

antisthenes , pupil of gorgias , stephen said , took the palm of beauty from kyrios menelaus’ brooddam , argive helen , the wooden mare of troy in whom a score of heroes slept , and handed it to poor penelope .	255263.3269596972
twenty years he lived in london and , during part of that time , he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of ireland .	3577.1555254981045
his life was rich .	2.0416149992927424

but all those twenty years what do you suppose poor penelope in stratford was doing behind the diamond panes ?	257.58417290528166
do and do .	1.4435174576444423
thing done .	1
in a rosery of fetter lane of gerard , herbalist , he walks , greyedauburn .	76.30640949165334
an azured harebell like her veins .	4.09867385582179

but do .	1
afar , in a reek of lust and squalor , hands are laid on whiteness .	74.02357394022857
buck mulligan rapped john eglinton’s desk sharply .	5.296623147436859
whom do you suspect ?	2.007227372125459
he challenged .	1
say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets .	10.94559632773959
once spurned twice spurned .	2.041484946544309
but the court wanton spurned him for a lord , his dearmylove .	23.720004000200124
love that dare not speak its name .	4.218798030208277
as an englishman , you mean , john sturdy eglinton put in , he loved a lord .	152.48208800825682
old wall where sudden lizards flash .	4.083204954821229
at charenton i watched them .	2.8907293591252965
it seems so , stephen said , when he wants to do for him , and for all other and singular uneared wombs , the holy office an ostler does for the stallion .	12380.972109060347
maybe , like socrates , he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife .	113.2560027653208
but she , the giglot wanton , did not break a bedvow .	27.019302911428852
two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined , deceased husband’s brother .	3148.924238593593
sweet ann , i take it , was hot in the blood .	25.14313326873692
once a wooer , twice a wooer .	5.914758123756969
stephen turned boldly in his chair .	3.965975569971816
the burden of proof is with you not with me , he said frowning .	41.260464737949796
if you deny that in the fifth scene of hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him .	312819.9506705826
all those women saw their men down and under mary , her goodman john , ann , her poor dear willun , when he went and died on her , raging that he was the first to go , joan , her four brothers , judith , her husband and all her sons , susan , her husband too , while susan’s daughter , elizabeth , to use granddaddy’s words , wed her second , having killed her first .	122658537188.98607
o , yes , mention there is .	4.435463845718539
in the years when he was living richly in royal london to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’s shepherd .	2059.1017772795826
explain you then .	1.4435176169263444
explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity .	23.411846388650588
he faced their silence .	2.041602406468488
to whom thus eglinton you mean the will .	8.270815647405824
but that has been explained , i believe , by jurists .	19.648070697321263
she was entitled to her widow’s dower at common law .	16.519667270405307
his legal knowledge was great our judges tell us .	11.580280627408191
him satan fleers , mocker and therefore he left out her name from the first draft but he did not leave out the presents for his granddaughter , for his daughters , for his sister , for his old cronies in stratford and in london .	1641900.4105746925
and therefore when he was urged , as i believe , to name her he left her his secondbest bed .	274.92735879744015
punkt .	1
leftherhis secondbest leftherhis bestabed secabest leftabed .	4.0829238878742204
woa !	1
pretty countryfolk had few chattels then , john eglinton observed , as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type .	929.6003688917892
he was a rich country gentleman , stephen said , with a coat of arms and landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard , a capitalist shareholder , a bill promoter , a tithefarmer .	65162.51379635246
why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace ?	884.6416200339386
it is clear that there were two beds , a best and a secondbest , mr secondbest best said finely .	511.79444550002177
separatio a mensa et a thalamo bettered buck mulligan and was smiled on .	47.14946923452823
antiquity mentions famous beds , second eglinton puckered , bedsmiling .	16.924534876829426
let me think .	1.3857879173990624
antiquity mentions that stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage , stephen said , who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves , pays tribute to his elders , wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress ( don’t forget nell gwynn herpyllis ) and let her live in his villa .	5185579978.479902
do you mean he died so ?	3.337077252376809
mr best asked with slight concern .	3.7886293670730824
i mean.. .	1
he died dead drunk , buck mulligan capped .	6.132114045791128
a quart of ale is a dish for a king .	14.447583938351517

for terms apply e. dowden , highfield house.. .	8.31236158937126
lovely !	1
buck mulligan suspired amorously .	2.041449039073887
i asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard .	77.33571882136633
he lifted his hands and said all we can say is that life ran very high in those days .	191.27537489405452
lovely !	1
catamite .	1
the sense of beauty leads us astray , said beautifulinsadness best to ugling eglinton .	56.37096504268985
steadfast john replied severe	1.4142326545788948
the doctor can tell us what those words mean .	11.569408687332134
you cannot eat your cake and have it .	8.27984738356192
sayest thou so ?	1.4193196479159018
will they wrest from us , from me , the palm of beauty ?	27.133641592891244
and the sense of property , stephen said .	7.053182344191114
he drew shylock out of his own long pocket .	6.825096887156546
the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender , with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots .	2319.851014402697
his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing .	380.3758138810782
he sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent .	2927.001732923851
how else could aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick ?	14.982705547870676
all events brought grist to his mill .	5.837120054941242
shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech lopez , his jew’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive hamlet and macbeth with the coming to the throne of a scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting .	5440752.6442494085
the lost armada is his jeer in love’s labour lost .	16.56383084432546
his pageants , the histories , sail fullbellied on a tide of mafeking enthusiasm .	68.63994531772443
warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s theory of equivocation .	26.185948966866842
the sea venture comes home from bermudas and the play renan admired is written with patsy caliban , our american cousin .	776.2796664429228
the sugared sonnets follow sidney’s .	2.887166795230059
as for fay elizabeth , otherwise carrotty bess , the gross virgin who inspired the merry wives of windsor let some meinherr from almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket .	160151.3991028725
i think you’re getting on very nicely .	5.3165057251183425
just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological .	5.372965556375704
mingo , minxi , mictum , mingere .	5.982601457360141
prove that he was a jew , john eglinton dared , expectantly .	15.356365191835739
your dean of studies holds he was a holy roman .	12.007285664123462
sufflaminandus sum .	1
he was made in germany , stephen replied , as the champion french polisher of italian scandals .	154.1906015482186
a myriadminded man , mr best reminded .	3.848427073409092
coleridge called him myriadminded .	2.0414520073344984
amplius .	1
in societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos .	32.667103848483364
saint thomas , stephen began.. .	2.510687733849717
ora pro nobis monk mulligan groaned , sinking to a chair .	21.817796593628938
there he keened a wailing rune .	4.1085515135506725
pogue mahone !	1
acushla machree !	1
it’s destroyed we are from this day !	4.963707483079588
it’s destroyed we are surely !	2.4671516357629897
all smiled their smiles .	2.0382322547631784
saint thomas , stephen smiling said , whose gorbellied works i enjoy reading in the original , writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new viennese school mr magee spoke of , likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions .	8691779.52442943
he means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who , it may be , hungers for it .	4932.90983947245
jews , whom christians tax with avarice , are of all races the most given to intermarriage .	194.64788645237704
accusations are made in anger .	2.6633299583864476
the christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews ( for whom , as for the lollards , storm was shelter ) bound their affections too with hoops of steel .	29830.899899111864
whether these be sins or virtues old nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet .	65.65470384644343
but a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife .	42612.121112181674
no sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass .	473.2621232734612
or his jennyass , buck mulligan antiphoned .	4.335747947046411
gentle will is being roughly handled , gentle mr best said gently .	27.30520332401305
which will ?	1
gagged sweetly buck mulligan .	2.038322057029608
we are getting mixed .	2.041521066325998
the will to live , john eglinton philosophised , for poor ann , will’s widow , is the will to die .	299.3481059880498
requiescat !	1
stephen prayed .	1
what of all the will to do ?	3.8890265491025753
it has vanished long ago.. .	2.888143496729703
she lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed , the mobled queen , even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes .	1967182.623346617
in old age she takes up with gospellers ( one stayed with her at new place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask ) and heard she had a soul .	2180096.210868506
she read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the merry wives and , loosing her nightly waters on the jordan , she thought over hooks and eyes for believers’ breeches and the most spiritual snuffbox to make the most devout souls sneeze .	3519269.6398527417
venus has twisted her lips in prayer .	5.822764120490077
agenbite of inwit remorse of conscience .	3.468772239817125
it is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god .	23.42594159391237
history shows that to be true , inquit eglintonus chronolologos .	15.359808271875352
the ages succeed one another .	2.8879964068225608
but we have it on high authority that a man’s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family .	461.30222571526014
i feel that russell is right .	3.745802559237488
what do we care for his wife or father ?	9.980151303600179
i should say that only family poets have family lives .	14.422669935180396
falstaff was not a family man .	3.4570994741049805
i feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation .	15.611525776049922
lean , he lay back .	2.773563402331361
shy , deny thy kindred , the unco guid .	11.893986801824694
shy , supping with the godless , he sneaks the cup .	24.187422807447945
a sire in ultonian antrim bade it him .	8.206785104247897
visits him here on quarter days .	4.097940498810582
mr magee , sir , there’s a gentleman to see you .	13.402642886810616

you will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays .	259.11973538779375
why did he take them rather than others ?	6.767855503742277
richard , a whoreson crookback , misbegotten , makes love to a widowed ann ( what’s in a name ?	271.4323205341651

richard the conqueror , third brother , came after william the conquered .	31.44137041204858
the other four acts of that play hang limply from that first .	33.287888617205105
of all his kings richard is the only king unshielded by shakespeare’s reverence , the angel of the world .	270.3585567607184
why is the underplot of king lear in which edmund figures lifted out of sidney’s arcadia and spatchcocked on to a celtic legend older than history ?	3252.269189787089
that was will’s way , john eglinton defended .	6.240815659540455
we should not now combine a norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by george meredith .	188.9858391033276
que voulez-vous ?	1
moore would say .	1.4435175209871802
he puts bohemia on the seacoast and makes ulysses quote aristotle .	23.693749033588652
why ?	1
stephen answered himself .	1.4435175705338703
because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to shakespeare , what the poor are not , always with him .	24580.953277338827
the note of banishment , banishment from the heart , banishment from home , sounds uninterruptedly from the two gentlemen of verona onward till prospero breaks his staff , buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book .	400856.35589503194
it doubles itself in the middle of his life , reflects itself in another , repeats itself , protasis , epitasis , catastasis , catastrophe .	2394.7180465726474
it repeats itself again when he is near the grave , when his married daughter susan , chip of the old block , is accused of adultery .	4285.363112627351
but it was the original sin that darkened his understanding , weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil .	973.8000862634013
the words are those of my lords bishops of maynooth .	15.318123475334081
an original sin and , like original sin , committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned .	329.62330279066515
it is between the lines of his last written words , it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid .	3235.3520592923533
age has not withered it .	2.8954637198859277
beauty and peace have not done it away .	8.203278653494788
it is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created , in much ado about nothing twice in as you like it in the tempest in hamlet in measure for measure and in all the other plays which i have not read .	576889.1813404631
he laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage .	16.508714979598615
judge eglinton summed up .	2.044411154402427
the truth is midway , he affirmed .	5.8946693575451885
he is the ghost and the prince .	4.315505371247088
he is all in all .	2.9017483315796895
he is , stephen said .	2.2817879054181254
the boy of act one is the mature man of act five .	33.52138511930661
all in all .	1.4388342589990326
in cymbeline in othello he is bawd and cuckold .	11.039615227777613
he acts and is acted on .	4.099446190972034
lover of an ideal or a perversion , like josé he kills the real carmen .	88.23195999695632

and what a character is iago !	4.0217452719542734
undaunted john eglinton exclaimed .	2.041474898165291
when all is said dumas fils ( or is it dumas père ?	25.76199947648511
is right .	1
after god shakespeare has created most .	4.085918348888659
man delights him not nor woman neither , stephen said .	16.672867719121108
he returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born , where he has always been , man and boy , a silent witness and there , his journey of life ended , he plants his mulberrytree in the earth .	2239739.5834959573
then dies .	1
the motion is ended .	2.041483087509145
gravediggers bury hamlet père and hamlet fils .	5.834314154163069
a king and a prince at last in death , with incidental music .	41.07395238141672
and , what though murdered and betrayed , bewept by all frail tender hearts for , dane or dubliner , sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced .	74680.75571929669
if you like the epilogue look long on it prosperous prospero , the good man rewarded , lizzie , grandpa’s lump of love , and nuncle richie , the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go .	1496199.467862445
strong curtain .	1
he found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible .	64.55840599326287
maeterlinck says if socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep .	135.8670759186174
if judas go forth tonight it is to judas his steps will tend .	32.720436774138946
every life is many days , day after day .	9.756083605800994
we walk through ourselves , meeting robbers , ghosts , giants , old men , young men , wives , widows , brothers-in-love , but always meeting ourselves .	9003.824631803684
the playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly ( he gave us light first and the sun two days later ), the lord of things as they are whom the most roman of catholics call dio boia hangman god , is doubtless all in all in all of us , ostler and butcher , and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven , foretold by hamlet , there are no more marriages , glorified man , an androgynous angel , being a wife unto himself .	47051103551621.43
eureka !	1
buck mulligan cried .	1.4150486231464614

those who are married , mr best , douce herald , said , all save one , shall live .	248.31904793511453

he laughed , unmarried , at eglinton johannes , of arts a bachelor .	44.714794891154675
unwed , unfancied , ware of wiles , they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of the taming of the shrew .	813.0780291820952
you are a delusion , said roundly john eglinton to stephen .	19.074800997954554
you have brought us all this way to show us a french triangle .	43.00671234634407
do you believe your own theory ?	4.018393652970926
no , stephen said promptly .	2.11094558741548
are you going to write it ?	2.3905395157868843
mr best asked .	1.3945318699042237

it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people .	886095.1646522356
on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s. j. of saint francis xavier’s church , upper gardiner street , stepped on to an outward bound tram .	2505.9789062954073
off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c. c. of saint agatha’s church , north william street , on to newcomen bridge .	3155.0166335902004
at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island .	1731.6616849995025
father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar , a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove , while four shillings , a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse .	845663.5222308952
passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket .	1085.3898204102788
the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap .	367.1557480292024
father conmee liked cheerful decorum .	2.8870943198216694
it was a peaceful day .	2.1489353789100147
the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down .	51.28807919031843
his wife , father conmee supposed .	3.2602319235152017
a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses .	58.17092925907228
she raised her small gloved fist , yawned ever so gently , tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily , sweetly .	3003.591722545911
father conmee perceived her perfume in the car .	8.336347485188895
he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat .	299.568391315677
father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head .	1124.9027830487455
at annesley bridge the tram halted and , when it was about to go , an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight .	1118.519125158127
the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her .	22.032855511644623
she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that , as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare , she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you , my child that they have been absolved , pray for me .	868056637.6983284
but they had so many worries in life , so many cares , poor creatures .	81.21617629130164
from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee .	42.636044809784
father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s. j. and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night .	299993279.56534684
that book by the belgian jesuit , le nombre des élus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea .	219.05007415752192
those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not ( d.v. ) been brought .	1524.7893728923978
but they were god’s souls , created by god .	11.226200596906494
it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost , a waste , if one might say .	503.1141782945106
at the howth road stop father conmee alighted , was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn .	354.294390550087
the malahide road was quiet .	2.893198395030408
it pleased father conmee , road and name .	7.057378256190754
the joybells were ringing in gay malahide .	5.807824788804883
lord talbot de malahide , immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining .	71.13605916748295
then came the call to arms and she was maid , wife and widow in one day .	144.10031387976883
those were old worldish days , loyal times in joyous townlands , old times in the barony .	179.4312855627768
father conmee , walking , thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort , daughter of lord molesworth , first countess of belvedere .	202172.37030883913
a listless lady , no more young , walked alone the shore of lough ennel , mary , first countess of belvedere , listlessly walking in the evening , not startled when an otter plunged .	59494.735855913015
who could know the truth ?	2.8708410256813854
not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully , eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husband’s brother ?	5127.6022066387595
she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did .	42.80040652143541
only god knew and she and he , her husband’s brother .	19.656237430241536
father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence , needed however for man’s race on earth , and of the ways of god which were not our ways .	2561.8644380810933
don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore .	14.11691796431904
he was humane and honoured there .	4.129064188430136
he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom , ceiled with full fruit clusters .	1308.4572075427227
and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom , noble to noble , were impalmed by don john conmee .	694.0162969607854
it was a charming day .	2.149150939559552
the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages , curtseying to him with ample underleaves .	238.1219109762244
the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind .	79.91440969908166
moutonner the french said .	2.042958965424929
a just and homely word .	2.887635808365916
father conmee , reading his office , watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey .	67.79877240936476
his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field .	21.740896439131554
he walked there , reading in the evening , and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play , young cries in the quiet evening .	4574.809461625712
he was their rector his reign was mild .	8.218790960448557
father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out .	28.04475261580028
an ivory bookmark told him the page .	5.850964362947016
nones .	1
he should have read that before lunch .	5.319283258322757
but lady maxwell had come .	2.8867739105997097
father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast .	33.722640847653736
deus in adiutorium .	1.4435178964393902
he walked calmly and read mutely the nones , walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ .	16510.696949423545
a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand .	2641.6205426631627
the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig .	1018.3739271460631
father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary .	43.722976797620156
sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum .	46.544472363121606
corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner .	482.49113162925244
he pulled himself erect , went to it and , spinning it on its axle , viewed its shape and brass furnishings .	899.8695826767022
chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway .	53.217584308844444
there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase , looking idly out .	449.2869242798147
father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge .	21.176565090938734
corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed , his hat downtilted , chewing his blade of hay .	205.63509115644163
constable 57c , on his beat , stood to pass the time of day .	51.87837848827563
that’s a fine day , mr kelleher .	4.539555812946634
ay , corny kelleher said .	2.3126559249175607
it’s very close , the constable said .	5.446496756261658
corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin .	3871.1641367581055
what’s the best news ?	1.5369888698859724
he asked .	1
i seen that particular party last evening , the constable said with bated breath .	54.28509916985496
a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnell’s corner , skirting rabaiotti’s icecream car , and jerked himself up eccles street .	502.6462549284128
towards larry o’rourke , in shirtsleeves in his doorway , he growled unamiably	28.87542724310996
for england .. .	1.3129663988881681
he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus , halted and growled	39.04274772775303
home and beauty .	1.2196476253658075
j. j. o’molloy’s white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor .	163.61003067074026
a stout lady stopped , took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her .	652.6735042437313
the sailor grumbled thanks , glanced sourly at the unheeding windows , sank his head and swung himself forward four strides .	607.5805571199342
he halted and growled angrily	2.000054194345324
for england .. .	1.3129663988881681
two barefoot urchins , sucking long liquorice laces , halted near him , gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths .	724.5229383529334
he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks , halted , lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply	232.67794148442522
home and beauty .	1.2196476253658075
the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two , ceased .	67.1593762103212
the blind of the window was drawn aside .	7.233287707540653
a card unfurnished apartments slipped from the sash and fell .	14.553009243302075
a plump bare generous arm shone , was seen , held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps .	390.9921115275121
a woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings .	20.499194435226514
it fell on the path .	2.725717401563508
one of the urchins ran to it , picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap , saying	156.01722780148117
there , sir .	1.4382673600252849
katey and boody dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen .	20.135379262323724
did you put in the books ?	3.749674022351388
boody asked .	1
maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow .	537.1220279004638
they wouldn’t give anything on them , she said .	8.560117354309392
father conmee walked through clongowes fields , his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble .	37.8214626190884
where did you try ?	1.611998195406358
boody asked .	1
m’guinness’s .	1
boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table .	23.72034994487321
bad cess to her big face !	4.026445756549554
she cried .	1
katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes .	13.352100097778923
what’s in the pot ?	1.8407618914527533
she asked .	1
shirts , maggy said .	1.6523585879011367
boody cried angrily	1
crickey , is there nothing for us to eat ?	10.520277105454964
katey , lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt , asked	47.86427395166104
and what’s in this ?	2.008082745636574
a heavy fume gushed in answer .	4.109398968602681
peasoup , maggy said .	1.6523585879011367
where did you get it ?	2.3148914819262547
katey asked .	1
sister mary patrick , maggy said .	3.3639033912698655
the lacquey rang his bell .	2.50235603491903
barang !	1
boody sat down at the table and said hungrily	6.177310778572476
give us it here .	2.0377258043697
maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl .	23.531646768646397
katey , sitting opposite boody , said quietly , as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs	157.04519321514147
a good job we have that much .	5.319671093757899
where’s dilly ?	1
gone to meet father , maggy said .	4.759094216793067
boody , breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup , added	31.281449515369925
our father who art not in heaven .	5.070505984439025
maggy , pouring yellow soup in katey’s bowl , exclaimed	11.603334008302765
boody !	1
for shame !	1
a skiff , a crumpled throwaway , elijah is coming , rode lightly down the liffey , under loopline bridge , shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers , sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains , between the customhouse old dock and george’s quay .	2054575.3956192492
the blond girl in thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre .	28.88401588930135
blazes boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar .	96.02456541999679
put these in first , will you ?	4.3567000731539025
he said .	1
yes , sir , the blond girl said .	5.381575549887147
and the fruit on top .	2.8944178054577683
that’ll do , game ball , blazes boylan said .	9.472126544428288
she bestowed fat pears neatly , head by tail , and among them ripe shamefaced peaches .	137.2765464708566
blazes boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop , lifting fruits , young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes , sniffing smells .	7347.453297768898
h. e. l. y.’s filed before him , tallwhitehatted , past tangier lane , plodding towards their goal .	224.48171994538436
he turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries , drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain’s length .	1187.9570154936484
can you send them by tram ?	4.028129069164216
now ?	1
a darkbacked figure under merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s cart .	21.218243562804933
certainly , sir .	1.3185092475407356
is it in the city ?	1.5627968625794206
o , yes , blazes boylan said .	4.100578492785269
ten minutes .	1
the blond girl handed him a docket and pencil .	9.890994833482129
will you write the address , sir ?	5.840452776419187
blazes boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her .	29.64005596845934
send it at once , will you ?	4.3501933885701884
he said .	1
it’s for an invalid .	2.0414460574801185
yes , sir .	1.3467567976403798
i will , sir .	1.6220860436780609
blazes boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket .	10.355736426714738
what’s the damage ?	1.4193212175477754
he asked .	1
the blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits .	8.263244633900479
blazes boylan looked into the cut of her blouse .	9.405773282537469
a young pullet .	1.4435178964393902
he took a red carnation from the tall stemglass .	9.459844194666664
this for me ?	1.4183663900485173
he asked gallantly .	1.4435178964393902
the blond girl glanced sideways at him , got up regardless , with his tie a bit crooked , blushing .	345.8040827181025
yes , sir , she said .	2.5137335363191706
bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches .	16.511696972116997
blazes boylan looked in her blouse with more favour , the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth .	362.15712921253936
may i say a word to your telephone , missy ?	13.97043243714474
he asked roguishly .	1.4435178964393902
ma !	1
almidano artifoni said .	1.4150488284497778
he gazed over stephen’s shoulder at goldsmith’s knobby poll .	11.57373604149774
two carfuls of tourists passed slowly , their women sitting fore , gripping the handrests .	97.01119698303137
palefaces .	1
men’s arms frankly round their stunted forms .	5.783987471910208
they looked from trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of ireland where pigeons roocoocooed .	122.6194907948213
anch’io ho avuto di queste idee almidano artifoni said , quand’ ero giovine come lei .	80.53190244741381
eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia .	16.332630485140317
è peccato .	1
perchè la sua voce.. .	2.041449039073887
sarebbe un cespite di rendita , via .	5.877642484232924
invece , lei si sacrifica .	2.887131018805183
sacrifizio incruento stephen said smiling , swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint , lightly .	163.10182417232798
speriamo the round mustachioed face said pleasantly .	5.7810578773225005
ma , dia retta a me .	4.113588208702089
ci rifletta .	1
by the stern stone hand of grattan , bidding halt , an inchicore tram unloaded straggling highland soldiers of a band .	787.8291305242101
ci rifletterò stephen said , glancing down the solid trouserleg .	9.487406904620222
ma , sul serio , eh ?	4.0809348238665
almidano artifoni said .	1.4150488284497778
his heavy hand took stephen’s firmly .	4.084133470405433
human eyes .	1
they gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a dalkey tram .	30.43221067403311
eccolo almidano artifoni said in friendly haste .	4.842880068356572
venga a trovarmi e ci pensi .	4.083056581142242
addio , caro .	1.4435177082283914
arrivederla , maestro stephen said , raising his hat when his hand was freed .	40.54706520719031
e grazie .	1
di che ?	1
almidano artifoni said .	1.4150488284497778
scusi , eh ?	1.4174020098090772
tante belle cose !	1.4187722396036229
almidano artifoni , holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal , trotted on stout trousers after the dalkey tram .	1014.7997974576832
in vain he trotted , signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through trinity gates .	783.3836124514892
miss dunne hid the capel street library copy of the woman in white far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter .	6498.9724350272545
too much mystery business in it .	4.120126959256687
is he in love with that one , marion ?	7.890746477738562
change it and get another by mary cecil haye .	10.622963060309884
the disk shot down the groove , wobbled a while , ceased and ogled them six .	83.04562562706307
miss dunne clicked on the keyboard	2.871626087429858
16 june 1904 .	1.4435178964393902
five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between monypeny’s corner and the slab where wolfe tone’s statue was not , eeled themselves turning h. e. l. y.’s and plodded back as they had come .	14186.30838990782
then she stared at the large poster of marie kendall , charming soubrette , and , listlessly lolling , scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses .	3322.948398055496
mustard hair and dauby cheeks .	2.647604688872046
she’s not nicelooking , is she ?	4.098290326939992
the way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt .	11.567776536930486
wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight .	11.72070499668008
if i could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like susy nagle’s .	51.24945492586133
they kick out grand .	2.0415295425583526
shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her .	21.36153097746056
hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven .	16.416008813062902
the telephone rang rudely by her ear .	5.803231483079458
hello .	1

two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch .	24.06743235350034

ned lambert asked .	1.3581066670605706

ned lambert said , raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches .	47.809365313428586
come on .	1
mind your steps there .	2.043448790164022
the vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall .	271.1419399421509
at their feet its red speck died and mouldy air closed round them .	46.715739343516844
how interesting !	1
a refined accent said in the gloom .	4.849090551202858
yes , sir , ned lambert said heartily .	4.582840147865496
we are standing in the historic council chamber of saint mary’s abbey where silken thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534 .	525.1030415829038
this is the most historic spot in all dublin .	7.929892006428943
o’madden burke is going to write something about it one of these days .	35.25644249001815
the old bank of ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in adelaide road .	19128.902964686025
you were never here before , jack , were you ?	12.947606202997488
no , ned .	1.3724065180940146
he rode down through dame walk , the refined accent said , if my memory serves me .	156.46088660348366
the mansion of the kildares was in thomas court .	11.795254141951263
that’s right , ned lambert said .	3.599445601655695
that’s quite right , sir .	2.1197196670112386

i’ll get those bags cleared away from the windows .	11.707907096596355
you can take it from here or from here .	11.64449726818162
in the still faint light he moved about , tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor .	1507.7936643508708
from a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard .	24.742277665385302
i’m deeply obliged , mr lambert , the clergyman said .	14.972684893973469

very pleased to have met you .	4.093274215751824
pleasure is mine , sir , ned lambert answered .	6.8945576076846615
he followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars .	121.15416735002142
with j. j. o’molloy he came forth slowly into mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal , o’connor , wexford .	4046.1143107593825
he stood to read the card in his hand .	11.556600667830637

he’s well up in history , faith .	5.904918144397683
the young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig .	32.861507354853764
i thought you were at a new gunpowder plot , j. j. o’molloy said .	38.220016360498
ned lambert cracked his fingers in the air .	8.494134419146514
god !	1
he cried .	1
i forgot to tell him that one about the earl of kildare after he set fire to cashel cathedral .	187.41611931598976
you know that one ?	1.5548679093007094
i’m bloody sorry i did it says he , but i declare to god i thought the archbishop was inside .	317.4676709129369
he mightn’t like it , though .	3.9486016528739687

god , i’ll tell him anyhow .	3.7517564263224807
that was the great earl , the fitzgerald mor .	9.12591192950523
hot members they were all of them , the geraldines .	8.884643883558534
the horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness .	16.36281530340752
he slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried	10.499667200415074
woa , sonny !	1.4187722396036229
he turned to j. j. o’molloy and asked	2.8488810510111726
well , jack .	1.441001634211835
what is it ?	1.239447462923871
what’s the trouble ?	1.4193197829793531
wait awhile .	1
hold hard .	1
with gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and , after an instant , sneezed loudly .	211.0343157376337
chow !	1
he said .	1
blast you !	1
the dust from those sacks , j. j. o’molloy said politely .	13.5295036913693

tom rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat .	82.70746708052923

he said .	1
say it’s turn six .	2.0416260676946973
in here , see .	1.8703907712562127
turn now on .	1.2189509099574576
he slid it into the left slot for them .	8.655565900523731
it shot down the groove , wobbled a while , ceased , ogling them six .	60.18050980791404
lawyers of the past , haughty , pleading , beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to nisi prius court richie goulding carrying the costbag of goulding , collis and ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude .	444424429.4175821
see ?	1
he said .	1

the impact .	1
leverage , see ?	1.4181031870085914
he showed them the rising column of disks on the right .	22.08404607937209
smart idea , nosey flynn said , snuffling .	6.6795997291723666
so a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over .	189.5304216764773
see ?	1
tom rochford said .	1.312966254321225
he slid in a disk for himself and watched it shoot , wobble , ogle , stop four .	258.5058462724003
turn now on .	1.2189509099574576
i’ll see him now in the ormond , lenehan said , and sound him .	35.42128383198849
one good turn deserves another .	2.8877396232589465

tell him i’m boylan with impatience .	4.048751069734685
goodnight , m’coy said abruptly .	2.2261255707480827
when you two begin.. .	2.0414475331891553
nosey flynn stooped towards the lever , snuffling at it .	16.894949751708157
but how does it work here , tommy ?	7.564911893170885
he asked .	1
tooraloo , lenehan said .	1.9096983252451112
see you later .	1.4435178023358575
he followed m’coy out across the tiny square of crampton court .	23.65392702120211
he’s a hero , he said simply .	4.036389120516806
i know , m’coy said .	2.5820423161102246
the drain , you mean .	2.636052122693403
drain ?	1
lenehan said .	1
it was down a manhole .	2.905150105481188
they passed dan lowry’s musichall where marie kendall , charming soubrette , smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile .	420.41677314182095
going down the path of sycamore street beside the empire musichall lenehan showed m’coy how the whole thing was .	296.4529693409653
one of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it , half choked with sewer gas .	913.3810918021701
down went tom rochford anyhow , booky’s vest and all , with the rope round him .	81.74404100858355
and be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up .	134.79148033519644
the act of a hero , he said .	6.793707498452415
at the dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for jervis street .	190.61127367506919
this way , he said , walking to the right .	10.343464806906399
i want to pop into lynam’s to see sceptre’s starting price .	17.935915186054807
what’s the time by your gold watch and chain ?	9.992347020393305
m’coy peered into marcus tertius moses’ sombre office , then at o’neill’s clock .	47.14953445839023
after three , he said .	2.8403344325804234
who’s riding her ?	1.4193198220298018
o. madden , lenehan said .	2.701126088533326
and a game filly she is .	4.0941403250778485
while he waited in temple bar m’coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter .	1574.65936453395
fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark .	94.59661354149519
the gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade .	65.46362402722892
even money , lenehan said returning .	3.1046573124764967
i knocked against bantam lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly .	419.40335445387177
through here .	1
they went up the steps and under merchants’ arch .	9.086051052835533
a darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart .	8.169178930423794
there he is , lenehan said .	3.0744254290831416
wonder what he’s buying , m’coy said , glancing behind .	11.279784626072384
leopoldo or the bloom is on the rye lenehan said .	13.087589129940831
he’s dead nuts on sales , m’coy said .	6.4821742624219745
i was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in liffey street for two bob .	590.4710865346316
there were fine plates in it worth double the money , the stars and the moon and comets with long tails .	631.7553884064347
astronomy it was about .	1.9612879843073172
lenehan laughed .	1
i’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails , he said .	34.67480792171688
come over in the sun .	2.60827451392616
they crossed to the metal bridge and went along wellington quay by the riverwall .	55.712802132083674
master patrick aloysius dignam came out of mangan’s , late fehrenbach’s , carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks .	190.4788652442962
there was a long spread out at glencree reformatory , lenehan said eagerly .	24.57760060702554
the annual dinner , you know .	4.014602046695376
boiled shirt affair .	1.4435178023358575
the lord mayor was there , val dillon it was , and sir charles cameron and dan dawson spoke and there was music .	923.232539041365
bartell d’arcy sang and benjamin dollard.. .	4.124989687920304
i know , m’coy broke in .	3.500368284812827
my missus sang there once .	2.8904727845043903
did she ?	1
lenehan said .	1
a card unfurnished apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 eccles street .	41.172553856235446
he checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh .	41.07239336742128
but wait till i tell you , he said .	6.363009426754037
delahunt of camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher .	47.38151764445569
bloom and the wife were there .	2.998216224992546
lashings of stuff we put up port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice .	269.5654929188236
fast and furious it was .	2.8975977273580105
after liquids came solids .	2.041446331814873
cold joints galore and mince pies.. .	4.124976822616005
i know , m’coy said .	2.5820423161102246
the year the missus was there.. .	3.751292448128895
lenehan linked his arm warmly .	2.6476707486006013
but wait till i tell you , he said .	6.363009426754037
we had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before .	2460.555920004411
coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the featherbed mountain .	22.73861045678245
bloom and chris callinan were on one side of the car and i was with the wife on the other .	220.05925937832566
we started singing glees and duets lo , the early beam of morning .	48.55739783794991
she was well primed with a good load of delahunt’s port under her bellyband .	54.29854743286256
every jolt the bloody car gave i had her bumping up against me .	42.73867285359295
hell’s delights !	1
she has a fine pair , god bless her .	9.09757680980351
like that .	1
he held his caved hands a cubit from him , frowning	13.112679389275677
i was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time .	68.05264688689654
know what i mean ?	2.0705806935733766
his hands moulded ample curves of air .	5.830252463051586
he shut his eyes tight in delight , his body shrinking , and blew a sweet chirp from his lips .	510.96628684271093
the lad stood to attention anyhow , he said with a sigh .	22.079548204757224
she’s a gamey mare and no mistake .	5.76435029830196
bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to chris callinan and the jarvey the great bear and hercules and the dragon , and the whole jingbang lot .	32265.32663697751
but , by god , i was lost , so to speak , in the milky way .	67.55310800365905
he knows them all , faith .	3.1333557005265864
at last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away .	15.090764569094556
and what star is that , poldy ?	4.88028982249723
says she .	1
by god , she had bloom cornered .	3.922943867463049
that one , is it ?	1.9094981315725974
says chris callinan , sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick .	41.773606586616886
by god , he wasn’t far wide of the mark .	13.598538502741903
lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall , panting with soft laughter .	31.041889280921556
i’m weak , he gasped .	2.895497142644201
m’coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave .	23.471655210652248
lenehan walked on again .	1.9639414430824915
he lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly .	9.333968321790287
he glanced sideways in the sunlight at m’coy .	8.340518319946362
he’s a cultured allroundman , bloom is , he said seriously .	15.050997034445512
he’s not one of your common or garden.. .	6.807996673114986
you know.. .	1
there’s a touch of the artist about old bloom .	11.069640751980812
mr bloom turned over idly pages of the awful disclosures of maria monk then of aristotle’s masterpiece .	138.4751217934796
crooked botched print .	1.4435178964393902
plates infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows .	62.74269115848527
lots of them like that at this moment all over the world .	27.019490012967452
all butting with their skulls to get out of it .	11.875769073477201
child born every minute somewhere .	2.8873043916928354
mrs purefoy .	1
he laid both books aside and glanced at the third tales of the ghetto by leopold von sacher masoch .	302.7370288765822
that i had , he said , pushing it by .	10.257775720353624
the shopman let two volumes fall on the counter .	10.773851236028955
them are two good ones , he said .	8.18216185399154
onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth .	31.07701111316004
he bent to make a bundle of the other books , hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain .	1781.1519989891622
on o’connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of mr denis j maginni , professor of dancing &c .	404.8989667327574
mr bloom , alone , looked at the titles .	7.2391467041878625
fair tyrants by james lovebirch .	2.882569983590411
know the kind that is .	2.899825114487209
had it ?	1
yes .	1
he opened it .	1.4412018966943019
thought so .	1
a woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain .	5.041893903746888
listen the man .	1.4408114316660625
no she wouldn’t like that much .	4.098479856248665
got her it once .	2.0418656098202166
he read the other title sweets of sin .	6.944051649857253
more in her line .	1.872363958648569
let us see .	1.4435174637533397
he read where his finger opened .	4.101350583067517
all the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies .	271.7844515767931
for him !	1
for raoul !	1
yes .	1
this .	1
here .	1
try .	1
her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé .	486.6563747356278
yes .	1
take this .	1
the end .	1
you are late , he spoke hoarsely , eying her with a suspicious glare .	63.048123828994264
the beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap , displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint .	124.01847801621109
an imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly .	56.378514250718176
mr bloom read again the beautiful woman .	5.648260866218785
warmth showered gently over him , cowing his flesh .	11.817355132003597

most scandalous revelation .	1.4435178964393902
not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst .	23.66086383060024
what i can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that.. .	66.76278748156528

hello , simon , father cowley said .	3.7168628956923513
how are things ?	1.4391327996773255
hello , bob , old man , mr dedalus answered , stopping .	17.891790751775606
they clasped hands loudly outside reddy and daughter’s .	8.25104772544687
father cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand .	20.221920993322648
what’s the best news ?	1.5369888698859724
mr dedalus said .	1.4224126200749143
why then not much , father cowley said .	6.887993271956976
i’m barricaded up , simon , with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance .	218.4993931871234
jolly , mr dedalus said .	2.424472771075234
who is it ?	1.418056072477815
o , father cowley said .	2.081834666205605
a certain gombeen man of our acquaintance .	5.840007045295401
with a broken back , is it ?	4.865996761256514
mr dedalus asked .	1.256577396872272
the same , simon , father cowley answered .	4.231928026001449
reuben of that ilk .	2.041445515705253
i’m just waiting for ben dollard .	4.0923187899637865
he’s going to say a word to long john to get him to take those two men off .	149.5012214017033
all i want is a little time .	4.6144246805799005
he looked with vague hope up and down the quay , a big apple bulging in his neck .	173.82906738173315
i know , mr dedalus said , nodding .	5.0918557996063925
poor old bockedy ben !	2.006659277392514
he’s always doing a good turn for someone .	8.248716018821241
hold hard !	1
he put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant .	32.00693928572355
there he is , by god , he said , arse and pockets .	26.35750471786921
ben dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge .	727.1170273033705
he came towards them at an amble , scratching actively behind his coattails .	47.437973043086174
as he came near mr dedalus greeted	3.0935224698283346
hold that fellow with the bad trousers .	4.108096734815491
hold him now , ben dollard said .	5.077995474036491
mr dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of ben dollard’s figure .	46.885860184837604
then , turning to father cowley with a nod , he muttered sneeringly	26.485542683279167
that’s a pretty garment , isn’t it , for a summer’s day ?	22.27391792285653
why , god eternally curse your soul , ben dollard growled furiously , i threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw .	2221.605895320625
he stood beside them beaming , on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff , saying	1428.4004095110806
they were made for a man in his health , ben , anyhow .	29.56024385038643
bad luck to the jewman that made them , ben dollard said .	29.912111623711514
thanks be to god he’s not paid yet .	6.840902443673444
and how is that basso profondo benjamin ?	4.313355189488365
father cowley asked .	1.4435174694130422
cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell , murmuring , glassyeyed , strode past the kildare street club .	65.67021491153265
ben dollard frowned and , making suddenly a chanter’s mouth , gave forth a deep note .	138.6013814923836
aw !	1
he said .	1
that’s the style , mr dedalus said , nodding to its drone .	21.548955774331066
what about that ?	1.203597589069554
ben dollard said .	1.3403312035411956
not too dusty ?	1.4193206437257702
what ?	1
he turned to both .	1.609134707839709
that’ll do , father cowley said , nodding also .	6.329805232409763
the reverend hugh c. love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint mary’s abbey past james and charles kennedy’s , rectifiers , attended by geraldines tall and personable , towards the tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles .	100583.34363672146
ben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward , his joyful fingers in the air .	335.95320136800666
come along with me to the subsheriff’s office , he said .	15.415455999650828
i want to show you the new beauty rock has for a bailiff .	31.319546924981942
he’s a cross between lobengula and lynchehaun .	5.834792722157359
he’s well worth seeing , mind you .	5.384462593685854
come along .	1
i saw john henry menton casually in the bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if i don’t.. .	544.6674597534171
wait awhile.. .	1
we’re on the right lay , bob , believe you me .	14.744284308336635
for a few days tell him , father cowley said anxiously .	13.3919365003078
ben dollard halted and stared , his loud orifice open , a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright .	116540.13644393618
what few days ?	1.4193196933173426
he boomed .	1
hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent ?	4.027614738429452
he has , father cowley said .	3.1069779296560864
then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on , ben dollard said .	130.0599703141202
the landlord has the prior claim .	3.338195857429298
i gave him all the particulars .	3.1966115012509535
29 windsor avenue .	1.4435177351166402
love is the name ?	2.0062906053433123
that’s right , father cowley said .	3.106630229519003
the reverend mr love .	1.8731916971886726
he’s a minister in the country somewhere .	5.120277410933113
but are you sure of that ?	3.279822880981961
you can tell barabbas from me , ben dollard said , that he can put that writ where jacko put the nuts .	616.3178538529287
he led father cowley boldly forward , linked to his bulk .	23.773544898205166
filberts i believe they were , mr dedalus said , as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront , following them .	233.46356458688197
the youngster will be all right , martin cunningham said , as they passed out of the castleyard gate .	112.75264736372387
the policeman touched his forehead .	2.8985518026170833
god bless you , martin cunningham said , cheerily .	7.14339287892297
he signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards lord edward street .	272.1352368724684
bronze by gold , miss kennedy’s head by miss douce’s head , appeared above the crossblind of the ormond hotel .	288.27841361476356
yes , martin cunningham said , fingering his beard .	7.695220474953778
i wrote to father conmee and laid the whole case before him .	24.607842187909924
you could try our friend , mr power suggested backward .	12.37648921744555
boyd ?	1
martin cunningham said shortly .	1.4930042235298295
touch me not .	1.4421167143339542
john wyse nolan , lagging behind , reading the list , came after them quickly down cork hill .	200.24233843421192
on the steps of the city hall councillor nannetti , descending , hailed alderman cowley and councillor abraham lyon ascending .	362.09868462710716
the castle car wheeled empty into upper exchange street .	10.603129411293166
look here , martin , john wyse nolan said , overtaking them at the mail office .	71.73727934899853
i see bloom put his name down for five shillings .	13.014364895566572
quite right , martin cunningham said , taking the list .	8.005110807149753
and put down the five shillings too .	5.847566681484561
without a second word either , mr power said .	9.530921986752501
strange but true , martin cunningham added .	4.2391809259264095
john wyse nolan opened wide eyes .	3.1055996234433905
i’ll say there is much kindness in the jew , he quoted , elegantly .	69.33605223159171
they went down parliament street .	2.648727970555282
there’s jimmy henry , mr power said , just heading for kavanagh’s .	21.025363122204002
righto , martin cunningham said .	2.350386574492881
here goes .	1
outside la maison claire blazes boylan waylaid jack mooney’s brother-in-law , humpy , tight , making for the liberties .	315.4106712007568
john wyse nolan fell back with mr power , while martin cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit , who walked uncertainly , with hasty steps past micky anderson’s watches .	138765.93067288472
the assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble , john wyse nolan told mr power .	116.78642602035958
they followed round the corner towards james kavanagh’s winerooms .	9.31677689032932
the empty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate .	23.348197956680202
martin cunningham , speaking always , showed often the list at which jimmy henry did not glance .	146.2574985316248
and long john fanning is here too , john wyse nolan said , as large as life .	83.80420517142316
the tall form of long john fanning filled the doorway where he stood .	32.13342892796218
good day , mr subsheriff , martin cunningham said , as all halted and greeted .	41.16514189160145
long john fanning made no way for them .	6.3689798314906305
he removed his large henry clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces .	265.95276330604173
are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations ?	8.038520338192175
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk .	18.869182734305415
hell open to christians they were having , jimmy henry said pettishly , about their damned irish language .	262.9122540391568
where was the marshal , he wanted to know , to keep order in the council chamber .	98.21287886331204
and old barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma , no mace on the table , nothing in order , no quorum even , and hutchinson , the lord mayor , in llandudno and little lorcan sherlock doing locum tenens for him .	750787.5049726444
damned irish language , language of our forefathers .	7.344254780780004
long john fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips .	15.280596641492055
martin cunningham spoke by turns , twirling the peak of his beard , to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff , while john wyse nolan held his peace .	3620.4502853333993
what dignam was that ?	2.0137215573533354
long john fanning asked .	1.5857287873655788
jimmy henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot .	16.683228271166943
o , my corns !	1.6197559642017805
he said plaintively .	1.4435177082283914
come upstairs for goodness’ sake till i sit down somewhere .	16.380003841540677
uff !	1
ooo !	1
mind !	1
testily he made room for himself beside long john fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs .	269.7792357782132
come on up , martin cunningham said to the subsheriff .	8.259765532607526
i don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did , though .	26.650106501470376
with john wyse nolan mr power followed them in .	8.140498054891987
decent little soul he was , mr power said to the stalwart back of long john fanning ascending towards long john fanning in the mirror .	733.5885815715774
rather lowsized .	1
dignam of menton’s office that was , martin cunningham said .	11.426786313941184
long john fanning could not remember him .	4.500345549119321
clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air .	5.788048766779914
what’s that ?	1
martin cunningham said .	1.380456666853818
all turned where they stood .	2.891112973142468
john wyse nolan came down again .	3.109910894411518
from the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street , harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering .	751.748814347762
gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes , not quickly .	29.14634010144403
in saddles of the leaders , leaping leaders , rode outriders .	24.212794497019416
what was it ?	1.1769568377672437
martin cunningham asked , as they went on up the staircase .	20.94204444228572
the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland , john wyse nolan answered from the stairfoot .	54.811902290862186
as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his panama to haines	60.12081155114745
parnell’s brother .	1
there in the corner .	2.0304530904737477
they chose a small table near the window , opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard .	743.9608655535571
is that he ?	1.3070225655119354
haines asked , twisting round in his seat .	7.579370649903119
yes , mulligan said .	2.022969201878621
that’s john howard , his brother , our city marshal .	15.540131354993886
john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested .	513.5731233930476
an instant after , under its screen , his eyes looked quickly , ghostbright , at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner .	3564.563457168119
i’ll take a mélange haines said to the waitress .	7.5455538908853175
two mélanges buck mulligan said .	2.524014340049334
and bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well .	28.09092833976887
when she had gone he said , laughing	3.8274998163338063
we call it d.b.c. because they have damn bad cakes .	15.012681602365486
o , but you missed dedalus on hamlet .	8.211358301378983
haines opened his newbought book .	2.8875031222887526
i’m sorry , he said .	2.8407314984719467
shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance .	43.107096058681186
the onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 nelson street	16.396995869512512
england expects .. .	1.4435173499768932
buck mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter .	11.676718983387143
you should see him , he said , when his body loses its balance .	34.419061730779134
wandering ængus i call him .	2.6210578158113633
i am sure he has an idée fixe haines said , pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger .	252.03255538360378
now i am speculating what it would be likely to be .	15.342146956926909
such persons always have .	2.040843289544391
buck mulligan bent across the table gravely .	5.573393484569019
they drove his wits astray , he said , by visions of hell .	32.769903550901844
he will never capture the attic note .	5.08158544773761
the note of swinburne , of all poets , the white death and the ruddy birth .	78.90039209188532
that is his tragedy .	1.8721069571901605
he can never be a poet .	3.3153965965337377
the joy of creation.. .	2.041446132066742

i see .	1
i tackled him this morning on belief .	4.6583239550255735
there was something on his mind , i saw .	8.760030304217064
it’s rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an interesting point out of that .	88.73109646516943
buck mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come .	8.270512887854109
he helped her to unload her tray .	5.827875785003326
he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth , haines said , amid the cheerful cups .	240.5022336429984
the moral idea seems lacking , the sense of destiny , of retribution .	41.44981188161868
rather strange he should have just that fixed idea .	10.644694378363608
does he write anything for your movement ?	5.701236183796786
he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream .	33.4091259236543
buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith .	94.79757991916304
he bit off a soft piece hungrily .	5.811309824569074
ten years , he said , chewing and laughing .	8.644516048098778
he is going to write something in ten years .	9.050760168202693
seems a long way off , haines said , thoughtfully lifting his spoon .	30.406285689804747
still , i shouldn’t wonder if he did after all .	12.416622294937284
he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup .	23.76272247673536
this is real irish cream i take it , he said with forbearance .	20.77867871736499
i don’t want to be imposed on .	4.5239890002171865
elijah , skiff , light crumpled throwaway , sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers , amid an archipelago of corks , beyond new wapping street past benson’s ferry , and by the threemasted schooner rosevean from bridgwater with bricks .	588582.4990685112
almidano artifoni walked past holles street , past sewell’s yard .	13.975932280058181
behind him cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell , with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling , shunned the lamp before mr law smith’s house and , crossing , walked along merrion square .	5333.604609205776
distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of college park .	60.36287353640984
cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell walked as far as mr lewis werner’s cheerful windows , then turned and strode back along merrion square , his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling .	2607.4799641629033
at the corner of wilde’s house he halted , frowned at elijah’s name announced on the metropolitan hall , frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn .	3276.4591071882373
his eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun .	5.731961966538422
with ratsteeth bared he muttered	2.0058709899873843
coactus volui .	1
he strode on for clare street , grinding his fierce word .	21.868155042061574
as he strode past mr bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards , having buffeted a thewless body .	25381.204494155572
the blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form .	20.454375385300175
god’s curse on you , he said sourly , whoever you are !	12.00764430323187
you’re blinder nor i am , you bitch’s bastard !	9.580452009887493
opposite ruggy o’donohoe’s master patrick aloysius dignam , pawing the pound and a half of mangan’s , late fehrenbach’s , porksteaks he had been sent for , went along warm wicklow street dawdling .	18883.366809841384
it was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with mrs stoer and mrs quigley and mrs macdowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle barney brought from tunney’s .	460279.746204862
and they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake , jawing the whole blooming time and sighing .	139.0311020173939
after wicklow lane the window of madame doyle , courtdress milliner , stopped him .	55.1070366189967
he stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props .	162.1115016290889
from the sidemirrors two mourning masters dignam gaped silently .	11.556831831879974
myler keogh , dublin’s pet lamb , will meet sergeantmajor bennett , the portobello bruiser , for a purse of fifty sovereigns .	627.6998879160499
gob , that’d be a good pucking match to see .	15.168093334896048
myler keogh , that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash .	41.05834893896809
two bar entrance , soldiers half price .	5.8787272400832995
i could easy do a bunk on ma .	8.249344553554272
master dignam on his left turned as he turned .	10.132330381116192
that’s me in mourning .	2.0398791642588976
when is it ?	1.3068218183364004
may the twentysecond .	1.4435178964393902
sure , the blooming thing is all over .	8.193843496716479
he turned to the right and on his right master dignam turned , his cap awry , his collar sticking up .	382.7972506843955
buttoning it down , his chin lifted , he saw the image of marie kendall , charming soubrette , beside the two puckers .	588.8477012405882
one of them mots that do be in the packets of fags stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out .	4901.116314082324
master dignam got his collar down and dawdled on .	11.7705143510202
the best pucker going for strength was fitzsimons .	7.533769847279349
one puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week , man .	201.4128328941302
but the best pucker for science was jem corbet before fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him , dodging and all .	576.1284638795883
in grafton street master dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time .	106515.6090246199
no sandymount tram .	1.4435177351166402
master dignam walked along nassau street , shifted the porksteaks to his other hand .	64.17786491777494
his collar sprang up again and he tugged it down .	14.047623017254619
the blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt , blooming end to it .	184.987124866688
he met schoolboys with satchels .	2.8990572771941547
i’m not going tomorrow either , stay away till monday .	15.257310695030739
he met other schoolboys .	2.0414993567881
do they notice i’m in mourning ?	3.7292811255514904
uncle barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight .	13.124479842771425
then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name .	63.973302726515854
his face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye .	1222.3593811074113
the scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs .	602.0085506724563
pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle barney telling the men how to get it round the bend .	1309.317522644701
a big coffin it was , and high and heavylooking .	14.271858548834937
how was that ?	1.418816137712145
the last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt .	94902.30821218224
never see him again .	1.8716943513827475
death , that is .	1.6291746034410233
pa is dead .	1.4404204263662088
my father is dead .	2.0374720546967113
he told me to be a good son to ma .	8.253425849915299
i couldn’t hear the other things he said but i saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better .	586.0615578720366
poor pa .	1
that was mr dignam , my father .	5.883024883853064
i hope he’s in purgatory now because he went to confession to father conroy on saturday night .	147.22151182377885

decent fellow joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it .	77.55651175056528

for trading without a licence , says he .	6.205415212357883
in inisfail the fair there lies a land , the land of holy michan .	41.22582631007792
there rises a watchtower beheld of men afar .	7.567637819090721
there sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept , warriors and princes of high renown .	194.07302369233204
a pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters , fishful streams where sport the gurnard , the plaice , the roach , the halibut , the gibbed haddock , the grilse , the dab , the brill , the flounder , the pollock , the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated .	1892327238.995783
in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage , the wafty sycamore , the lebanonian cedar , the exalted planetree , the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied .	29559296.772459578
lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots , silvery fishes , crans of herrings , drafts of eels , codlings , creels of fingerlings , purple seagems and playful insects .	77334164.08365673
and heroes voyage from afar to woo them , from eblana to slievemargy , the peerless princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruachan’s land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle , princes , the sons of kings .	28058003.432699375
and there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose , and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for o’connell fitzsimon takes toll of them , a chieftain descended from chieftains .	26333289.762110896

come out here , geraghty , you notorious bloody hill and dale robber !	47.62980392505821
and by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves and there is ever heard a trampling , cackling , roaring , lowing , bleating , bellowing , rumbling , grunting , champing , chewing , of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy vales of thomond , from the m’gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly shannon the unfathomable , and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of kiar , their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds , various in size , the agate with this dun .	2.661134018399159e+27
so we turned into barney kiernan’s and there , sure enough , was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel , garryowen , and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink .	1739094.1133384241
there he is , says i , in his gloryhole , with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers , working for the cause .	1329.5864193360771
the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps .	42.570467380383896
be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog .	97.03806101323941
i’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence .	18882.68705582545
stand and deliver , says he .	3.8833634438176046

friends here .	1

then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he	11.044681618032916
what’s your opinion of the times ?	4.103892321566329
doing the rapparee and rory of the hill .	8.109049232876867
but , begob , joe was equal to the occasion .	12.555131514417537
i think the markets are on a rise , says he , sliding his hand down his fork .	187.8340105208309
so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says	30.089785071114203
foreign wars is the cause of it .	5.176835934761967
and says joe , sticking his thumb in his pocket	8.714625808730792
it’s the russians wish to tyrannise .	4.109617896992079
arrah , give over your bloody codding , joe , says i. i’ve a thirst on me i wouldn’t sell for half a crown .	1062.4116718454172

eh ?	1
and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and , by jesus , he near throttled him .	625.6743993175957
the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero .	58887.6880688405
from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered , as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible , with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus .	2495010.8823229643
the widewinged nostrils , from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected , were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest .	16970.72330073591
the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower .	1035.305204371432
a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground , the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble .	62496932.48848438
he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes .	41291.05949958856
beneath this he wore trews of deerskin , roughly stitched with gut .	33.7327053568415
his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple , the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast .	21420.672563134187
from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity , cuchulin , conn of hundred battles , niall of nine hostages , brian of kincora , the ardri malachi , art macmurragh , shane o’neill , father john murphy , owen roe , patrick sarsfield , red hugh o’donnell , red jim macdermott , soggarth eoghan o’growney , michael dwyer , francy higgins , henry joy m’cracken , goliath , horace wheatley , thomas conneff , peg woffington , the village blacksmith , captain moonlight , captain boycott , dante alighieri , christopher columbus , s. fursa , s. brendan , marshal macmahon , charlemagne , theobald wolfe tone , the mother of the maccabees , the last of the mohicans , the rose of castile , the man for galway , the man that broke the bank at monte carlo , the man in the gap , the woman who didn’t , benjamin franklin , napoleon bonaparte , john l. sullivan , cleopatra , savourneen deelish , julius caesar , paracelsus , sir thomas lipton , william tell , michelangelo hayes , muhammad , the bride of lammermoor , peter the hermit , peter the packer , dark rosaleen , patrick w. shakespeare , brian confucius , murtagh gutenberg , patricio velasquez , captain nemo , tristan and isolde , the first prince of wales , thomas cook and son , the bold soldier boy , arrah na pogue , dick turpin , ludwig beethoven , the colleen bawn , waddler healy , angus the culdee , dolly mount , sidney parade , ben howth , valentine greatrakes , adam and eve , arthur wellesley , boss croker , herodotus , jack the giantkiller , gautama buddha , lady godiva , the lily of killarney , balor of the evil eye , the queen of sheba , acky nagle , joe nagle , alessandro volta , jeremiah o’donovan rossa , don philip o’sullivan beare .	2.7500749876958986e+52
a couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber , a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone .	824778986.7662681
so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid .	2933.1392329881137
o , as true as i’m telling you .	6.707375754098481

says bob doran .	1.4199475998638338

hurry up , terry boy , says alf .	6.80488536937168
terence o’ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats , cunning as the sons of deathless leda .	277425.9976480035
for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil , those cunning brothers , lords of the vat .	17613502.47249725
then did you , chivalrous terence , hand forth , as to the manner born , that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted , the soul of chivalry , in beauty akin to the immortals .	543898.8915094392
but he , the young chief of the o’bergan’s , could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze .	14409.472484873975
thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port , scion of the house of brunswick , victoria her name , her most excellent majesty , by grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the sea , queen , defender of the faith , empress of india , even she , who bore rule , a victress over many peoples , the wellbeloved , for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof , the pale , the dark , the ruddy and the ethiop .	5553770818872727.0
what’s that bloody freemason doing , says the citizen , prowling up and down outside ?	41.03686632440863

hangmen’s letters .	1

says i.	1

who’s dead ?	1

dead !	1
says alf .	1
he’s no more dead than you are .	5.102818091608526
maybe so , says joe .	2.6019297358884566
they took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow .	14.397108818267663
paddy ?	1
says alf .	1
ay , says joe .	1.8189593472079553
he paid the debt of nature , god be merciful to him .	30.992299913051006
good christ !	1
says alf .	1
begob he was what you might call flabbergasted .	6.550724248798353
in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible , the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face .	132955796.57566302
communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus .	3003.491224506696
questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels .	441400.13337730826
in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them .	1329747.5269864234
interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā , ālāvātār , hātākāldā , wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature .	366422055.88091147
having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief .	41.05760895412889
asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power .	10712266.348883146
it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you , friends of earth , who are still in the body .	42681.508011802325
mind c. k. doesn’t pile it on .	5.802781134974815
it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher , manager of messrs h. j. o’neill’s popular funeral establishment , a personal friend of the defunct , who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements .	433729.2737924002
before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good .	18661091.372489285
he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known .	2025.9080534621069
assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction .	276.2277986768156
he is gone from mortal haunts o’dignam , sun of our morning .	33.680067507086534
fleet was his foot on the bracken patrick of the beamy brow .	31.071756851184755
wail , banba , with your wind and wail , o ocean , with your whirlwind .	118.26155930283522
there he is again , says the citizen , staring out .	8.414123555543169
who ?	1
says i.	1
bloom , says he .	1.7470489133274856
he’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes .	22.28276326746348
and , begob , i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again .	129.25979745422347
little alf was knocked bawways .	2.887112438279804
faith , he was .	1.699370702251314
good christ !	1
says he .	1
i could have sworn it was him .	4.4462760357080615
and says bob doran , with the hat on the back of his poll , lowest blackguard in dublin when he’s under the influence	809.0267672846079
who said christ is good ?	2.8459131331332177
i beg your parsnips , says alf .	4.810798927983593
is that a good christ , says bob doran , to take away poor little willy dignam ?	85.47800928606576
ah , well , says alf , trying to pass it off .	16.540099161981775
he’s over all his troubles .	2.898180955877661
but bob doran shouts out of him .	5.356042380774598
he’s a bloody ruffian , i say , to take away poor little willy dignam .	49.829426608319174
terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet , that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises .	2686.115153282557
and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam , true as you’re there .	66.4227146624386
the finest man , says he , snivelling , the finest purest character .	29.1426277607193
the tear is bloody near your eye .	5.773155745911529
talking through his bloody hat .	2.8883808286186086
fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married , mooney , the bumbailiff’s daughter , mother kept a kip in hardwicke street , that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her , exposing her person , open to all comers , fair field and no favour .	4043606720.360869
the noblest , the truest , says he .	8.2353289312708
and he’s gone , poor little willy , poor little paddy dignam .	21.340101853428152
and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven .	92.29732984609471
old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door .	42.60783229364223
come in , come on , he won’t eat you , says the citizen .	27.705016021411186
so bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there .	213.77598595709506
o , christ m’keown , says joe , reading one of the letters .	27.20510991668935
listen to this , will you ?	2.808628438757786
and he starts reading out one .	4.249918161030807
7 hunter street , liverpool .	2.839023873212628
to the high sheriff of dublin , dublin .	5.96474516687206
honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the 12 of febuary 1900 and i hanged.. .	12713.370459552389
show us , joe , says i.	2.753247060499665
.. .	1
private arthur chace for fowl murder of jessie tilsit in pentonville prison and i was assistant when.. .	166.40976469384333
jesus , says i.	1.2970250679475968
.. .	1
billington executed the awful murderer toad smith.. .	5.774347064269903
the citizen made a grab at the letter .	6.90157682129193
hold hard , says joe , i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain , honoured sir , my terms is five ginnees .	75348.85083546574
h. rumbold , master barber .	2.509204907002935
and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too , says the citizen .	18.667286581751906
and the dirty scrawl of the wretch , says joe .	15.315272609707002
here , says he , take them to hell out of my sight , alf .	52.7839124275374
hello , bloom , says he , what will you have ?	12.79491339197357
so they started arguing about the point , bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar .	28926.45655799561
gob , he’s a prudent member and no mistake .	9.414520575451133
give us one of your prime stinkers , terry , says joe .	24.440394310501446
and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it .	366.5221497103452
they’re all barbers , says he , from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses .	1351.3109900453653
and he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull .	459975.8182906748
in the dark land they bide , the vengeful knights of the razor .	36.389502473119585
their deadly coil they grasp yea , and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord .	46769.23408430058
so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on .	650684761.504998
there’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on , says alf .	27.698146309735094
what’s that ?	1
says joe .	1
the poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged , says alf .	14.843742378266278
that so ?	1
says joe .	1
god’s truth , says alf .	2.5769550393460485
i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady , the invincible .	311.71047338472926
he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker .	564.0149809785307
ruling passion strong in death , says joe , as someone said .	24.3405181818532
that can be explained by science , says bloom .	10.992180353397686
it’s only a natural phenomenon , don’t you see , because on account of the.. .	51.183862043896106
and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon .	149.03913429729621
the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would , according to the best approved tradition of medical science , be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus , thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis .	1.3344038605131044e+18
so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged , drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this , that and the other .	5642249932.996053
talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought .	91.48808825416097
mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs .	58.12960524094966
and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get .	696.8127890359627
so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him	14.976449531513229
give us the paw !	1.785814217373797
give the paw , doggy !	2.650600793950609
good old doggy !	1.418770788003526
give the paw here !	1.7482282808295817
give us the paw !	1.785814217373797
arrah , bloody end to the paw he’d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip .	4449086.1300099585
then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs’ tin he told terry to bring .	831.2000127577145
gob , he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more .	396.0256855017731
near ate the tin and all , hungry bloody mongrel .	14.607367684758712
and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point , the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country , the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she’s far from the land .	1610288.114384589
and bloom , of course , with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face .	128.4939796224251
phenomenon !	1
the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley .	227.7601500511459
time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk .	32831622905.54836
and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and , by the holy farmer , he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings , if the three women didn’t near roast him , it’s a queer story , the old one , bloom’s wife and mrs o’dowd that kept the hotel .	46325605997.92812
jesus , i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat .	47.781089360275956
and bloom with his but don’t you see ?	6.400622264006976
and but on the other hand .	3.661319163611311
and sure , more be token , the lout i’m told was in power’s after , the blender’s , round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment .	3713745.567871201
phenomenon !	1
the memory of the dead , says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom .	75.36889919708116
ay , ay , says joe .	2.961760408777822
you don’t grasp my point , says bloom .	7.360856124485674
what i mean is.. .	1.7166759673982037
sinn fein !	1
says the citizen .	1.3420182592852534
sinn fein amhain !	1.4187722396036229
the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us .	94.92471665060827
the last farewell was affecting in the extreme .	7.585311874684856
from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance .	104421.55440314207
the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle .	47980.123523894756
a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons .	11556.84445680354
a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza’s plaintive muse .	46976545.232098274
special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents .	1313.5752604158956
considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l-n-h-n and m-ll-g-n who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion .	2697.8527057424603
our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies .	223429.63304442723
the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat .	58111875.54432304
the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite .	618031.2274804872
the delegation , present in full force , consisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone ( the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane ), monsieur pierrepaul petitépatant , the grandjoker vladinmire pokethankertscheff , the archjoker leopold rudolph von schwanzenbad-hodenthaler , countess marha virága kisászony putrápesthi , hiram y. bomboost , count athanatos karamelopulos , ali baba backsheesh rahat lokum effendi , señor hidalgo caballero don pecadillo y palabras y paternoster de la malora de la malaria , hokopoko harakiri , hi hung chang , olaf kobberkeddelsen , mynheer trik van trumps , pan poleaxe paddyrisky , goosepond prhklstr kratchinabritchisitch , borus hupinkoff , herr hurhausdirektorpresident hans chuechli-steuerli , nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor kriegfried ueberallgemein .	3.653401216058246e+18
all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness .	2429.2945292567606
an animated altercation ( in which all took part ) ensued among the f. o. t. e. i. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland’s patron saint .	262524.88733529317
in the course of the argument cannonballs , scimitars , boomerangs , blunderbusses , stinkpots , meatchoppers , umbrellas , catapults , knuckledusters , sandbags , lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged .	239534.97755952386
the baby policeman , constable macfadden , summoned by special courier from booterstown , quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties .	114715.73737647674
the readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted .	43.44319891655222
constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the f. o. t. e. i. , several of whom were bleeding profusely .	407.8599875850393
commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair , it was explained by his legal adviser avvocato pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses .	33616572.966910094
the objects ( which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches ) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme .	5357.423739723275
quietly , unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower , the gladiolus cruentus .	814.8922013382994
he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough which so many have tried ( unsuccessfully ) to imitate short , painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man .	11962.841041516744
the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse , the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries , hoch , banzai , eljen , zivio , chinchin , polla kronia , hiphip , vive , allah amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song ( a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers ) was easily distinguishable .	100644268786298.48
it was exactly seventeen o’clock .	2.887164312142402
the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared , the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero , which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi , being removed by his medical adviser in attendance , dr pippi .	12675521.084892705
the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater , his cassock above his hoary head , and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication .	33206849.098494384
hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner , his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously .	21558.457800213615
as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office .	868116.5287299627
on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife , the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances ( specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers , messrs john round and sons , sheffield ), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum , colon , blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim .	61464770450.98086
the housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution .	1097.132110631506
quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs , fried steak and onions , done to a nicety , delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he , with an abnegation rare in these our times , rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish ( immediately acceded to ) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem .	1.6988388209797597e+17
the nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake .	1867574.4802292709
the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly sheila , my own .	130.47537675732312
encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach .	18024.8829894775
she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory , that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park .	21064531.624311097
she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and , oblivious of the dreadful present , they both laughed heartily , all the spectators , including the venerable pastor , joining in the general merriment .	133200981.19584271
that monster audience simply rocked with delight .	5.7838557385027904
but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time .	89.77440053958172
a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people , touched to the inmost core , broke into heartrending sobs , not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself .	183523.56482933578
big strong men , officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary , were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage .	425895.5679311282
a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate , noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex , stepped forward and , presenting his visiting card , bankbook and genealogical tree , solicited the hand of the hapless young lady , requesting her to name the day , and was accepted on the spot .	140226867.13670665
every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch , a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young oxonian ( the bearer , by the way , of one of the most timehonoured names in albion’s history ) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds .	2399595137359.9897
nay , even the stern provostmarshal , lieutenantcolonel tomkin-maxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson , who presided on the sad occasion , he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching , could not now restrain his natural emotion .	623363.0017996279
with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard , by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone	40164.073729150026
god blimey if she aint a clinker , that there bleeding tart .	31.22465046772756
blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry , straight , it does , when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down limehouse way .	30835.232748484
so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink , the curse of ireland .	10001988527.301645
antitreating is about the size of it .	4.940909139277659
gob , he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint .	7740.057110169027
and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings , song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns , gob , flahoolagh entertainment , don’t be talking .	580952657347.5266
ireland sober is ireland free .	2.8876297182990953
and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of .	2306.1713156108212
and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females , hitting below the belt .	1586.81345262274
so howandever , as i was saying , the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me .	904.9643400069307
i’d train him by kindness , so i would , if he was my dog .	51.157075435852946
give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him .	54.58991082906735
afraid he’ll bite you ?	2.0110941181341784
says the citizen , jeering .	2.2043090284925264
no , says i. but he might take my leg for a lamppost .	29.149436590827918
so he calls the old dog over .	4.528834546430261
what’s on you , garry ?	2.13048436456199
says he .	1
then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling , letting on to answer , like a duet in the opera .	3810.4045743161623
such growling you never heard as they let off between them .	23.198263104287847
someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that .	10135.325419809922
growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws .	765.5934684612165
all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals ( and their name is legion ) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry .	1600760091.817819
the exhibition , which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system , comprises , among other achievements , the recitation of verse .	12850.005626520197
our greatest living phonetic expert ( wild horses shall not drag it from us !	64.6208650832238
) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance ( the italics are ours ) to the ranns of ancient celtic bards .	192322.80424224059
we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather ( as a contributor d. o. c. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary ) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye .	15686732845122.84
we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication .	605708.6235346205
the metrical system of the canine original , which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn , is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught .	360080.21507893555
perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour .	4813.911265612667
the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you , barney kiernan , has no sup of water to cool my courage , and my guts red roaring after lowry’s lights .	126101.22726430064
so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and , gob , you could hear him lapping it up a mile off .	1777.8281867535943
and joe asked him would he have another .	6.5646913922580135
i will , says he , a chara to show there’s no ill feeling .	40.80727983942264
gob , he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking .	10.114822800552748
arsing around from one pub to another , leaving it to your own honour , with old giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators .	8421.098598729122
entertainment for man and beast .	2.9168445047674627
and says joe	1
could you make a hole in another pint ?	6.564874136552074
could a swim duck ?	2.007293445258581
says i.	1
same again , terry , says joe .	4.826648973051879
are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment ?	29.929501349126802
says he .	1
thank you , no , says bloom .	2.6638597300974594
as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham , don’t you see , about this insurance of poor dignam’s .	556.7245749855186
martin asked me to go to the house .	4.982843674199127
you see , he , dignam , i mean , didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy .	36033.71565475801
holy wars , says joe , laughing , that’s a good one if old shylock is landed .	92.02184622717984
so the wife comes out top dog , what ?	11.580290730172504
well , that’s a point , says bloom , for the wife’s admirers .	27.39919815349516
whose admirers ?	1
says joe .	1
the wife’s advisers , i mean , says bloom .	8.771880982426541
then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act .	13783158018.42864
he was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court .	2401.7205499085467
selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery .	38.92472140152958
true as you’re there .	1.7602312903621817
o , commend me to an israelite !	5.723874715921547
royal and privileged hungarian robbery .	2.5112133106683796
so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer , a finer than poor little willy that’s dead to tell her .	77335384.0748768
choking with bloody foolery .	2.0414480466978757
and shaking bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that .	22.854589026132913
shake hands , brother .	2.0384550231769847
you’re a rogue and i’m another .	3.777831429288888
let me , said he , so far presume upon our acquaintance which , however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time , is founded , as i hope and believe , on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour .	8199860.637281464
but , should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness .	1114.5348760034913
no , rejoined the other , i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that , though the errand be one of sorrow , this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup .	93819427.52374516
then suffer me to take your hand , said he .	14.101016238706716
the goodness of your heart , i feel sure , will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy , were i to give vent to my feelings , would deprive me even of speech .	5133457.326249528
and off with him and out trying to walk straight .	10.778104716105188
boosed at five o’clock .	2.04149522893493
night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby , 14a. blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time , fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard , drinking porter out of teacups .	1625328.8706737503
and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls , joseph manuo , and talking against the catholic religion , and he serving mass in adam and eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut , who wrote the new testament , and the old testament , and hugging and smugging .	6412908.151628574
and the two shawls killed with the laughing , picking his pockets , the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another .	29791.310106411205
how is your testament ?	2.0072445103977543
have you got an old testament ?	3.3843178562115965
only paddy was passing there , i tell you what .	11.155882933054215
then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife , and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her , no less , and her violets , nice as pie , doing the little lady .	2881982.4861016157
jack mooney’s sister .	1.4435176947841466
and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples .	26.125434560556016
gob , jack made him toe the line .	8.273335158223166
told him if he didn’t patch up the pot , jesus , he’d kick the shite out of him .	306.0249080180856
so terry brought the three pints .	3.570031585846436
here , says joe , doing the honours .	5.002283900267469
here , citizen .	1.4392932874432705
slan leat says he .	2.0401224808474856
fortune , joe , says i. good health , citizen .	7.473197920009598
gob , he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already .	18.843721714823797
want a small fortune to keep him in drinks .	10.893149328009171
who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty , alf ?	16.50484499153862
says joe .	1
friend of yours , says alf .	3.5395635269249173
nannan ?	1
says joe .	1
the mimber ?	1
i won’t mention any names , says alf .	7.421307443907985
i thought so , says joe .	3.7400128113358466
i saw him up at that meeting now with william field , m. p. , the cattle traders .	154.86801189251312
hairy iopas , says the citizen , that exploded volcano , the darling of all countries and the idol of his own .	548.7511703314863
so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue .	31151226.395641338
because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard .	15.247086332285154
walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier .	19135.624946268308
mister knowall .	1
teach your grandmother how to milk ducks .	5.813523691501806
pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs o’dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her .	37323.03974815722
couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it .	342.76134772628546
what’s your programme today ?	2.0075781811617177
ay .	1
humane methods .	1
because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently .	3858.4445712825973
gob , he’d have a soft hand under a hen .	14.436633938435124
ga ga gara .	1.3129660602275715
klook klook klook .	1.2196477436640167
black liz is our hen .	2.888461169673073
she lays eggs for us .	2.894778856092929
when she lays her egg she is so glad .	11.63034087290461
gara .	1
klook klook klook .	1.2196477436640167
then comes good uncle leo .	2.8872382484372814
he puts his hand under black liz and takes her fresh egg .	33.13248144048312
ga ga ga ga gara .	2.208211116821343
klook klook klook .	1.2196477436640167
anyhow , says joe , field and nannetti are going over tonight to london to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons .	1753.0041653476546
are you sure , says bloom , the councillor is going ?	16.593239751030197
i wanted to see him , as it happens .	5.39419932785384
well , he’s going off by the mailboat , says joe , tonight .	33.282157968664684
that’s too bad , says bloom .	3.26043268201182
i wanted particularly .	1.4435178964393902
perhaps only mr field is going .	4.084141426566809
i couldn’t phone .	1.4435177552826162
no .	1
you’re sure ?	1
nannan’s going too , says joe .	3.8093073159046558
the league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding irish games in the park .	320.1993073972833
what do you think of that , citizen ?	4.5252823602034935

mr allfours ( tamoshant .	2.041446921764979

the man that got away james stephens .	4.184755193620024
the champion of all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot .	19.33445567522657
what was your best throw , citizen ?	5.7736518555571354
na bacleis says the citizen , letting on to be modest .	14.604704964826121
there was a time i was as good as the next fellow anyhow .	23.21074802730697
put it there , citizen , says joe .	5.445566384209949
you were and a bloody sight better .	5.3318099421094125
is that really a fact ?	2.854025152670928
says alf .	1
yes , says bloom .	1.7991976319017753
that’s well known .	1.4435175772897215
did you not know that ?	2.848321642368078
so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that .	160531.53064293214
and of course bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad .	784.8123053685615
i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom look at , bloom .	2229.4364276286187

declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady .	147.98542346106422
a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian o’ciarnain’s in sraid na bretaine bheag under the auspices of sluagh na h-eireann on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture , as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland , for the development of the race .	86384055.11956097
the venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions .	174.9854356792625
after an instructive discourse by the chairman , a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed , a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers .	7800230.169915364
the wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue , mr joseph m’carthy hynes , made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient gaelic sports and pastimes , practised morning and evening by finn maccool , as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages .	523220271.78638226
l. bloom , who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses , having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close , in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house , by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis’ evergreen verses ( happily too familiar to need recalling here ) a nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself .	20503565868095.59
the irish caruso-garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it .	12658.520898051518
his superb highclass vocalism , which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation , was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions .	8772036.750769239

talking about violent exercise , says alf , were you at that keogh-bennett match ?	40.596805887866516
no , says joe .	1.5110125567622739
i heard so and so made a cool hundred quid over it , says alf .	64.75240628017747
who ?	1
blazes ?	1
says joe .	1
and says bloom	1
what i meant about tennis , for example , is the agility and training the eye .	89.876325882427
ay , blazes , says alf .	3.704113770800733
he let out that myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time .	444.51630634029823
we know him , says the citizen .	2.946274850384107
the traitor’s son .	1.4435175647069327
we know what put english gold in his pocket .	11.67451357127533
true for you , says joe .	2.2181191729355594
and bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood , asking alf	128.43708131187728
now , don’t you think , bergan ?	3.514847207895656
myler dusted the floor with him , says alf .	6.988003876445115
heenan and sayers was only a bloody fool to it .	16.598395554650775
handed him the father and mother of a beating .	8.411470979168842
see the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping .	45.736260249782184
god , he gave him one last puck in the wind , queensberry rules and all , made him puke what he never ate .	1164.5447026748893
it was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns .	1441.730718398745
handicapped as he was by lack of poundage , dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft .	506.5549410763675
the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions .	23.60923693970623
the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts , the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose , and myler came on looking groggy .	859777.6541049416
the soldier got to business , leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of bennett’s jaw .	31419.001359992333
the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a left hook , the body punch being a fine one .	429.0499993957265
the men came to handigrips .	2.9057749961622505
myler quickly became busy and got his man under , the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes , myler punishing him .	2107.8709948340565
the englishman , whose right eye was nearly closed , took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck , confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in jigtime .	700378.1796967163
it was a fight to a finish and the best man for it .	28.37093172458344
the two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high .	16.522681028527753
the referee twice cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch .	546.9054812254393
after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to battling bennett’s stomach , flooring him flat .	3398177.353266368
it was a knockout clean and clever .	4.340788538339557
amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennett’s second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight .	2902932.497298018
he knows which side his bread is buttered , says alf .	21.12794744692529
i hear he’s running a concert tour now up in the north .	24.262207411552897

and whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the holy and undivided trinity , the daughter of the skies , the virgin moon being then in her first quarter , it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law .	166284824.0463858
there master courtenay , sitting in his own chamber , gave his rede and master justice andrews , sitting without a jury in the probate court , weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented jacob halliday , vintner , deceased , versus livingstone , an infant , of unsound mind , and another .	531808417301.76514
and to the solemn court of green street there came sir frederick the falconer .	53.2790462309394
and he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of dublin .	190866.82590225726
and there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of iar , for every tribe one man , of the tribe of patrick and of the tribe of hugh and of the tribe of owen and of the tribe of conn and of the tribe of oscar and of the tribe of fergus and of the tribe of finn and of the tribe of dermot and of the tribe of cormac and of the tribe of kevin and of the tribe of caolte and of the tribe of ossian , there being in all twelve good men and true .	1197966747306.1233
and he conjured them by him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them god and kiss the book .	26014016.74782276
and they rose in their seats , those twelve of iar , and they swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his rightwiseness .	8158.064238013849
and straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received .	3154.32198088614
and they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor .	4401.247723583182
those are nice things , says the citizen , coming over here to ireland filling the country with bugs .	196.6340623930634
so bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with joe , telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to mr crawford .	117895.33900609291
and so joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all .	231.78047879034003
because , you see , says bloom , for an advertisement you must have repetition .	45.38233601828533
that’s the whole secret .	2.04155981890431
rely on me , says joe .	3.743887286688412
swindling the peasants , says the citizen , and the poor of ireland .	19.17852671123723
we want no more strangers in our house .	8.236169409098617
o , i’m sure that will be all right , hynes , says bloom .	37.41767551021993
it’s just that keyes , you see .	4.810077431496214
consider that done , says joe .	3.745692860265573
very kind of you , says bloom .	3.665412768114349
the strangers , says the citizen .	2.7645852785015057
our own fault .	1.4435176705843038
we let them come in .	2.9040702367871525
we brought them in .	2.0544886585578808
the adulteress and her paramour brought the saxon robbers here .	16.581249416748754
decree nisi says j. j.	2.000521138222356
and bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing , a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel , and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when .	449954.9249472746
a dishonoured wife , says the citizen , that’s what’s the cause of all our misfortunes .	60.690282168944506
and here she is , says alf , that was giggling over the police gazette with terry on the counter , in all her warpaint .	1030.072845437616
give us a squint at her , says i.	5.380283790984221
and what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures terry borrows off of corny kelleher .	120.69609444084374

norman w. tupper , wealthy chicago contractor , finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer taylor .	254.41912721423896
belle in her bloomers misconducting herself , and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and norman w. tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer taylor .	322392.36669117736
o jakers , jenny , says joe , how short your shirt is !	35.26234220825095
there’s hair , joe , says i. get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one , what ?	333.6443374871699
so anyhow in came john wyse nolan and lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast .	539.3628885284926
well , says the citizen , what’s the latest from the scene of action ?	30.78502893273367
what did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the irish language ?	118.4756324701325
o’nolan , clad in shining armour , low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen , how that the grave elders of the most obedient city , second of the realm , had met them in the tholsel , and there , after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal , had taken solemn counsel whereby they might , if so be it might be , bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided gael .	330090485065969.75
it’s on the march , says the citizen .	5.628320702796696
to hell with the bloody brutal sassenachs and their patois .	15.450235969840017
so j. j. puts in a word , doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the nelson policy , putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation , and bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation .	883267338.3322582
their syphilisation , you mean , says the citizen .	6.990338787089193
to hell with them !	1.8809193436443774

any civilisation they have they stole from us .	8.187225472701225
tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts .	2.887091973728402
the european family , says j. j....	3.1081949705873115
they’re not european , says the citizen .	3.9796806254556993
i was in europe with kevin egan of paris .	8.510954970915751
you wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in europe except in a cabinet d’aisance .	272.2579000310322
and says john wyse	1.3414352313908278

perfide albion !	1
he said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and , uttering his tribal slogan lamh dearg abu he drank to the undoing of his foes , a race of mighty valorous heroes , rulers of the waves , who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods .	691619624.4890246
what’s up with you , says i to lenehan .	7.335354267115234
you look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner .	55.26399912610659
gold cup , says he .	2.594881109185258
who won , mr lenehan ?	2.840844890742775
says terry .	1
throwaway says he , at twenty to one .	5.477894528255687
a rank outsider .	1.4435178964393902

boylan plunged two quid on my tip sceptre for himself and a lady friend .	62.11311213471853
i had half a crown myself , says terry , on zinfandel that mr flynn gave me .	133.79292192840958
lord howard de walden’s .	1.8706993035966888
twenty to one , says lenehan .	3.02510240316834

takes the biscuit , and talking about bunions .	7.077921459774357
frailty , thy name is sceptre .	3.364142680772552
so he went over to the biscuit tin bob doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod , the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up .	88486.82469119345
old mother hubbard went to the cupboard .	4.674385804350776
not there , my child , says he .	7.141547827182908
keep your pecker up , says joe .	5.304882770780478
she’d have won the money only for the other dog .	13.393595268614241
and j. j. and the citizen arguing about law and history with bloom sticking in an odd word .	169.6292121968324
some people , says bloom , can see the mote in others’ eyes but they can’t see the beam in their own .	621.4850260439595
raimeis says the citizen .	1.8979949250085053
there’s no-one as blind as the fellow that won’t see , if you know what that means .	135.36589537086286
where are our missing twenty millions of irish should be here today instead of four , our lost tribes ?	378.54703071551904
and our potteries and textiles , the finest in the whole world !	23.99775618417717
and our wool that was sold in rome in the time of juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of antrim and our limerick lace , our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by ballybough and our huguenot poplin that we have since jacquard de lyon and our woven silk and our foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the carmelite convent in new ross , nothing like it in the whole wide world .	170107245834.32144
where are the greek merchants that came through the pillars of hercules , the gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind , with gold and tyrian purple to sell in wexford at the fair of carmen ?	149695.14783219766
read tacitus and ptolemy , even giraldus cambrensis .	8.313107905498985
wine , peltries , connemara marble , silver from tipperary , second to none , our farfamed horses even today , the irish hobbies , with king philip of spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters .	1513847.4434739253
what do the yellowjohns of anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths ?	131.74013996114581

the bride who was given away by her father , the m’conifer of the glands , looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk , moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey , sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe , the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze .	5298504423.610374
the maids of honour , miss larch conifer and miss spruce conifer , sisters of the bride , wore very becoming costumes in the same tone , a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral .	106749288.90043938
senhor enrique flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and , in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass , played a new and striking arrangement of woodman , spare that tree at the conclusion of the service .	885421.1923636899

mr and mrs wyse conifer neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the black forest .	64.35262845838047
and our eyes are on europe , says the citizen .	11.305754263673487
we had our trade with spain and the french and with the flemings before those mongrels were pupped , spanish ale in galway , the winebark on the winedark waterway .	15070.826212497164
and will again , says joe .	3.018704218761909
and with the help of the holy mother of god we will again , says the citizen , clapping his thigh .	210.89563141015
our harbours that are empty will be full again , queenstown , kinsale , galway , blacksod bay , ventry in the kingdom of kerry , killybegs , the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the galway lynches and the cavan o’reillys and the o’kennedys of dublin when the earl of desmond could make a treaty with the emperor charles the fifth himself .	12534621940.26028
and will again , says he , when the first irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore , none of your henry tudor’s harps , no , the oldest flag afloat , the flag of the province of desmond and thomond , three crowns on a blue field , the three sons of milesius .	196381434.02630648

cows in connacht have long horns .	4.08733841413293
as much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the molly maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant .	4083272.95841161

hanging over the bloody paper with alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public .	271.0352799673745
picture of a butting match , trying to crack their bloody skulls , one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate .	7338.341754860281
and another one black beast burned in omaha , ga .	16.75130691706122
a lot of deadwood dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him .	4944.275063271902
gob , they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job .	609.4187889086184
but what about the fighting navy , says ned , that keeps our foes at bay ?	82.90561183526395
i’ll tell you what about it , says the citizen .	5.796127189114839
hell upon earth it is .	2.6706440070204565
read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at portsmouth .	132.89613168079083
a fellow writes that calls himself disgusted one .	8.207361676767457
so he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out , howling for his ma , and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun .	92813479.91937245
a rump and dozen , says the citizen , was what that old ruffian sir john beresford called it but the modern god’s englishman calls it caning on the breech .	8393.18707224992
and says john wyse	1.3414352313908278
’tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance .	31.109557656888313
then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder .	49120.01707050437
that’s your glorious british navy , says the citizen , that bosses the earth .	37.22011327754099
the fellows that never will be slaves , with the only hereditary chamber on the face of god’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons .	18287.883460576308
that’s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs .	33.414590082459135
on which the sun never rises , says joe .	9.719030635337777
and the tragedy of it is , says the citizen , they believe it .	27.1432072831776
the unfortunate yahoos believe it .	2.8934211367225746
they believe in rod , the scourger almighty , creator of hell upon earth , and in jacky tar , the son of a gun , who was conceived of unholy boast , born of the fighting navy , suffered under rump and dozen , was scarified , flayed and curried , yelled like bloody hell , the third day he arose again from the bed , steered into haven , sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid .	3951885957156.242
but , says bloom , isn’t discipline the same everywhere .	13.401081158013882
i mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force ?	45.22077536490151
didn’t i tell you ?	1.5917283640081679
as true as i’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living .	880.9214181553893
we’ll put force against force , says the citizen .	7.205343882918194
we have our greater ireland beyond the sea .	6.872773427655006
they were driven out of house and home in the black 47 .	20.725069864886088
their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as redskins in america .	217160.09658034358
even the grand turk sent us his piastres .	8.205318046264567
but the sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro .	9037.438199615064
ay , they drove out the peasants in hordes .	10.803229249160502
twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships .	8.333150508566527
but those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage .	54.26382514892871
and they will come again and with a vengeance , no cravens , the sons of granuaile , the champions of kathleen ni houlihan .	1168.146019669554
perfectly true , says bloom .	2.69386955234181
but my point was.. .	2.041468491789769
we are a long time waiting for that day , citizen , says ned .	29.809904913985008
since the poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at killala .	159.67473614726907
ay , says john wyse .	1.6025615781948435
we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us against the williamites and they betrayed us .	135.9152850659289
remember limerick and the broken treatystone .	4.1309296209069535
we gave our best blood to france and spain , the wild geese .	48.312942838186736
fontenoy , eh ?	1.4174020098090772
and sarsfield and o’donnell , duke of tetuan in spain , and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria teresa .	1042.3857308683032

they were never worth a roasted fart to ireland .	11.698054990529705
aren’t they trying to make an entente cordiale now at tay pay’s dinnerparty with perfidious albion ?	119.51873177477205
firebrands of europe and they always were .	5.845991690864719
conspuez les français says lenehan , nobbling his beer .	10.241068265670572
and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians , says joe , haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george the elector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead ?	211946.51916684437
jesus , i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her , blind drunk in her royal palace every night of god , old vic , with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about ehren on the rhine and come where the boose is cheaper .	483008716404.05176
well , says j. j. we have edward the peacemaker now .	13.92472817766005
tell that to a fool , says the citizen .	7.428110832353574
there’s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo .	19.545391628654688

and what do you think , says joe , of the holy boys , the priests and bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode .	455652.0111516367
the earl of dublin , no less .	3.741353951551733
they ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself , says little alf .	80.78584743181179
and says j. j.	1.4143715024191514
considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision .	5.780763860623239
will you try another , citizen ?	4.082711249183798
says joe .	1
yes , sir , says he .	2.948762421537727
i will .	1
you ?	1
says joe .	1
beholden to you , joe , says i. may your shadow never grow less .	28.315353146349793
repeat that dose , says joe .	3.7456943651440735
bloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about .	1602.5904209873793
persecution , says he , all the history of the world is full of it .	42.47109645945854
perpetuating national hatred among nations .	2.887494475659039
but do you know what a nation means ?	6.393209743150026
says john wyse .	1.3483242057209017
yes , says bloom .	1.7991976319017753
what is it ?	1.239447462923871
says john wyse .	1.3483242057209017
a nation ?	1
says bloom .	1
a nation is the same people living in the same place .	16.23575795944919
by god , then , says ned , laughing , if that’s so i’m a nation for i’m living in the same place for the past five years .	2459.132762245507
so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he , trying to muck out of it	115.87090312201322
or also living in different places .	4.113379778853962
that covers my case , says joe .	5.297750424127233
what is your nation if i may ask ?	7.001869693235359
says the citizen .	1.3420182592852534
ireland , says bloom .	1.903924337542688
i was born here .	1.7196282342273903
ireland .	1
the citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and , gob , he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner .	4750.778111940024
after you with the push , joe , says he , taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry .	103.03340903783355
here you are , citizen , says joe .	4.03556564323676
take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words .	36.582517914113126
the muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient irish facecloth attributed to solomon of droma and manus tomaltach og macdonogh , authors of the book of ballymote , was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration .	81825.76147879162
no need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces , the acme of art , wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol , a bogoak sceptre , a north american puma ( a far nobler king of beasts than the british article , be it said in passing ), a kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill .	75631253851.76726
the scenes depicted on the emunctory field , showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones , are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the barmecides .	107632428.65034255
glendalough , the lovely lakes of killarney , the ruins of clonmacnois , cong abbey , glen inagh and the twelve pins , ireland’s eye , the green hills of tallaght , croagh patrick , the brewery of messrs arthur guinness , son and company ( limited ), lough neagh’s banks , the vale of ovoca , isolde’s tower , the mapas obelisk , sir patrick dun’s hospital , cape clear , the glen of aherlow , lynch’s castle , the scotch house , rathdown union workhouse at loughlinstown , tullamore jail , castleconnel rapids , kilballymacshonakill , the cross at monasterboice , jury’s hotel , s. patrick’s purgatory , the salmon leap , maynooth college refectory , curley’s hole , the three birthplaces of the first duke of wellington , the rock of cashel , the bog of allen , the henry street warehouse , fingal’s cave all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time .	2.9358122881165617e+26
show us over the drink , says i. which is which ?	16.679437046236806
that’s mine , says joe , as the devil said to the dead policeman .	32.03832399809859
and i belong to a race too , says bloom , that is hated and persecuted .	76.55573641123482
also now .	1
this very moment .	1.3857881011752418
this very instant .	1.4435177303716786
gob , he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar .	46.506713305623705
robbed , says he .	1.9981957717088574
plundered .	1
insulted .	1
persecuted .	1
taking what belongs to us by right .	5.827037455297472
at this very moment , says he , putting up his fist , sold by auction in morocco like slaves or cattle .	784.335653482513
are you talking about the new jerusalem ?	4.72472796924373
says the citizen .	1.3420182592852534
i’m talking about injustice , says bloom .	5.484163240680086
right , says john wyse .	1.894697511871412
stand up to it then with force like men .	11.6461390068135
that’s an almanac picture for you .	4.0921646888886105
mark for a softnosed bullet .	2.887071156414092
old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun .	16.46133962656263
gob , he’d adorn a sweepingbrush , so he would , if he only had a nurse’s apron on him .	296.8663520962145
and then he collapses all of a sudden , twisting around all the opposite , as limp as a wet rag .	505.31603391062686
but it’s no use , says he .	5.755989750742427
force , hatred , history , all that .	8.202270390028149
that’s not life for men and women , insult and hatred .	22.95892053473554
and everybody knows that it’s the very opposite of that that is really life .	62.06292065420834
what ?	1
says alf .	1
love , says bloom .	1.903924337542688
i mean the opposite of hatred .	3.78329910038425
i must go now , says he to john wyse .	10.515805881049861
just round to the court a moment to see if martin is there .	24.58122981986233
if he comes just say i’ll be back in a second .	18.067264466211963
just a moment .	1.426890868262246
who’s hindering you ?	1.4193190751166236
and off he pops like greased lightning .	5.7803778925798595
a new apostle to the gentiles , says the citizen .	11.462215512137243
universal love .	1
well , says john wyse .	1.6463665697125478

and this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but god loves everybody .	92.91094699313896
well , joe , says i , your very good health and song .	20.559554468835785
more power , citizen .	1.8668279990858019
hurrah , there , says joe .	3.1495968331815702
the blessing of god and mary and patrick on you , says the citizen .	34.985509191309504
and he ups with his pint to wet his whistle .	16.65392059592905
we know those canters , says he , preaching and picking your pocket .	35.65313050164181
what about sanctimonious cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of drogheda to the sword with the bible text god is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon ?	24928.311069142797
the bible !	1
did you read that skit in the united irishman today about that zulu chief that’s visiting england ?	151.0318280263071
what’s that ?	1
says joe .	1
so the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out	57.64737617690213
a delegation of the chief cotton magnates of manchester was presented yesterday to his majesty the alaki of abeakuta by gold stick in waiting , lord walkup of walkup on eggs , to tender to his majesty the heartfelt thanks of british traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions .	18911045.08555248
the delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate , in the course of a happy speech , freely translated by the british chaplain , the reverend ananias praisegod barebones , tendered his best thanks to massa walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between abeakuta and the british empire , stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible , the volume of the word of god and the secret of england’s greatness , graciously presented to him by the white chief woman , the great squaw victoria , with a personal dedication from the august hand of the royal donor .	1968683997836089.2
the alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast black and white from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty kakachakachak , surnamed forty warts , after which he visited the chief factory of cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book , subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance , in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks , amid hilarious applause from the girl hands .	85298975923.48264
widow woman , says ned .	2.6985604909186964
i wouldn’t doubt her .	2.0471304156849195
wonder did he put that bible to the same use as i would .	43.46450400246475
same only more so , says lenehan .	4.488574314317943
and thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly .	23.45519200987425
is that by griffith ?	2.007246313590999
says john wyse .	1.3483242057209017
no , says the citizen .	1.6758112414461046
it’s not signed shanganagh .	2.041448384242134
it’s only initialled p.	1.4143163864698038
and a very good initial too , says joe .	10.788109902429834
that’s how it’s worked , says the citizen .	5.628232966392548
trade follows the flag .	2.0404013090207047
well , says j. j. , if they’re any worse than those belgians in the congo free state they must be bad .	581.7642999286827
did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is ?	32.41006000950365
casement , says the citizen .	1.9539035178505864
he’s an irishman .	1.4435178964393902
yes , that’s the man , says j. j. raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them .	13813.849498242571
i know where he’s gone , says lenehan , cracking his fingers .	25.00814541870842
who ?	1
says i.	1
bloom , says he .	1.7470489133274856
the courthouse is a blind .	2.898618547769731
he had a few bob on throwaway and he’s gone to gather in the shekels .	51.16500041030429
is it that whiteeyed kaffir ?	2.4690683257568855
says the citizen , that never backed a horse in anger in his life ?	53.62111633599426
that’s where he’s gone , says lenehan .	4.840046484655616
i met bantam lyons going to back that horse only i put him off it and he told me bloom gave him the tip .	1185.6493902488312
bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on .	22.25577192223767
he’s the only man in dublin has it .	6.501863449339517
a dark horse .	1.4435177601502385
he’s a bloody dark horse himself , says joe .	8.918991465150585
mind , joe , says i. show us the entrance out .	12.12530351613451
there you are , says terry .	3.6766186350222685
goodbye ireland i’m going to gort .	3.3135571372428974
so i just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob ( hundred shillings to five ) while i was letting off my throwaway twenty to ) letting off my load gob says i to myself i knew he was uneasy in his ( two pints off of joe and one in slattery’s off ) in his mind to get off the mark to ( hundred shillings is five quid ) and when they were in the ( dark horse ) pisser burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick ( gob , must have done about a gallon ) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she’s better or she’s ( ow !	1.5953248684366637e+17
) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or ( jesus , full up i was ) trading without a licence ( ow !	9380.180821376358
) ireland my nation says he ( hoik !	8.056386712540332
phthook !	1
) never be up to those bloody ( there’s the last of it ) jerusalem ( ah !	164.7328867701205
) cuckoos .	1
so anyhow when i got back they were at it dingdong , john wyse saying it was bloom gave the ideas for sinn fein to griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering , packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling irish industries .	177913097.23574632
robbing peter to pay paul .	2.8873232498251156
gob , that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show .	269.9706257872811
give us a bloody chance .	2.2582752821256284
god save ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout .	14.186807333614022
mr bloom with his argol bargol .	3.496367437061326
and his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds , old methusalem bloom , the robbing bagman , that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds .	94978.72298664984
loans by post on easy terms .	3.9583706284124425
any amount of money advanced on note of hand .	11.716373638405855
distance no object .	1.4435176544509305
no security .	1
gob , he’s like lanty machale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with every one .	139.69621750914476
well , it’s a fact , says john wyse .	6.461789598727407
and there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it , martin cunningham .	29.382705837364263
sure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power with him and a fellow named crofter or crofton , pensioner out of the collector general’s , an orangeman blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense .	35901267.77627283
our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys .	23.683832348586588
ho , varlet !	1.4187722396036229
cried he , who by his mien seemed the leader of the party .	42.96251800716543
saucy knave !	1
to us !	1
so saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice .	33.349940636817955
mine host came forth at the summons , girding him with his tabard .	40.41555046391638
give you good den , my masters , said he with an obsequious bow .	48.73121228655062
bestir thyself , sirrah !	2.00645367914734
cried he who had knocked .	2.649597750781109
look to our steeds .	2.0414554807940877
and for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it .	43.31822932573981
lackaday , good masters , said the host , my poor house has but a bare larder .	148.04665671459648
i know not what to offer your lordships .	7.239595126254782
how now , fellow ?	1.8415693398067614
cried the second of the party , a man of pleasant countenance , so servest thou the king’s messengers , master taptun ?	670.213832948465
an instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage .	5.841920362455125
cry you mercy , gentlemen , he said humbly .	7.901035494164049
an you be the king’s messengers ( god shield his majesty !	21.18530132152671
) you shall not want for aught .	5.798911578059043
the king’s friends ( god bless his majesty !	8.063112953855132
) shall not go afasting in my house i warrant me .	23.37067673564364
then about !	1
cried the traveller who had not spoken , a lusty trencherman by his aspect .	61.90718472154463
hast aught to give us ?	2.6156294707872503
mine host bowed again as he made answer	5.217172933489203
what say you , good masters , to a squab pigeon pasty , some collops of venison , a saddle of veal , widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon , a boar’s head with pistachios , a bason of jolly custard , a medlar tansy and a flagon of old rhenish ?	16692813.592548465
gadzooks !	1
cried the last speaker .	2.0414592490229406
that likes me well .	2.038675209599531
pistachios !	1
aha !	1
cried he of the pleasant countenance .	3.786112898981867
a poor house and a bare larder , quotha !	11.20558286659402
’tis a merry rogue .	2.0414565660505843
so in comes martin asking where was bloom .	8.190091687385587
where is he ?	1.4444267080530107
says lenehan .	1
defrauding widows and orphans .	2.04145738680491
isn’t that a fact , says john wyse , what i was telling the citizen about bloom and the sinn fein ?	256.1059535131571
that’s so , says martin .	2.2950877280330597
or so they allege .	1.87201927501867
who made those allegations ?	2.0072283326348384
says alf .	1
i , says joe .	1.839023300019228
i’m the alligator .	1.4435178964393902
and after all , says john wyse , why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow ?	162.49454783935235
why not ?	1
says j. j. , when he’s quite sure which country it is .	27.558288020927684
is he a jew or a gentile or a holy roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he ?	415.30072625859424
says ned .	1
or who is he ?	1.5751072923543454
no offence , crofton .	2.0414832276077504
who is junius ?	1.4193212175477754
says j. j.	1
we don’t want him , says crofter the orangeman or presbyterian .	17.308073654680637
he’s a perverted jew , says martin , from a place in hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the hungarian system .	2109.9585010166024
we know that in the castle .	3.275120315485034
isn’t he a cousin of bloom the dentist ?	7.519085218763935
says jack power .	1.3096065845631752
not at all , says martin .	3.344578195281849
only namesakes .	1
his name was virag , the father’s name that poisoned himself .	19.40789688554744
he changed it by deedpoll , the father did .	10.377790158563766
that’s the new messiah for ireland !	4.026448845770831
says the citizen .	1.3420182592852534
island of saints and sages !	2.866777002065562
well , they’re still waiting for their redeemer , says martin .	19.87864572044358
for that matter so are we .	3.564200436629487
yes , says j. j. , and every male that’s born they think it may be their messiah .	151.89476058992565
and every jew is in a tall state of excitement , i believe , till he knows if he’s a father or a mother .	1685.99216178326
expecting every moment will be his next , says lenehan .	15.52772402786224
o , by god , says ned , you should have seen bloom before that son of his that died was born .	484.8610893377229
i met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered .	779.3566227069505

a many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and , clinging to the sides of the noble bark , they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair .	825387724088.9401

amid cheers that rent the welkin , responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant cambrian and caledonian hills , the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while , as it proceeded down the river , escorted by a flotilla of barges , the flags of the ballast office and custom house were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the pigeonhouse and the poolbeg light .	107304179567135.22

the epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the inn’s quay ward and parish of saint michan covering a surface of fortyone acres , two roods and one square pole or perch .	130782.28733682753
all the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself , in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress , is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive .	54513453.55963603

when , lo , there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein he stood ascend to heaven .	1173.0606887013898

the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace .	47.38132940391881
far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand , on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay , on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and , last but not least , on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man , mary , star of the sea .	33306894422134.37
the three girl friends were seated on the rocks , enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly .	1651.4527489070476
many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine , cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey , two little curlyheaded boys , dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name h. m. s. belleisle printed on both .	4867110947.840033
for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins , scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them .	69821.23701651779
they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets , building castles as children do , or playing with their big coloured ball , happy as the day was long .	30233.99261429741
and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight .	577.126598460755
he was but eleven months and nine days old and , though still a tiny toddler , was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words .	4139.0148578311155
cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin .	338.60828077478817
now , baby , cissy caffrey said .	4.985501241851452
say out big , big .	2.9392198198555217
i want a drink of water .	3.7791642453136314
and baby prattled after her	2.0069647952340643
a jink a jink a jawbo .	3.4525177328636545
cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children , so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on .	97814763.26684932
what a persuasive power that girl had !	5.701834703016715
but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold , a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib .	459.4656975176367
none of your spoilt beauties , flora macflimsy sort , was cissy caffrey .	38.85365396851445
a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life , always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips , a girl lovable in the extreme .	37780.12089374008
and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother .	25.82624356021368
but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky .	47.5794178996874
boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule .	86.4273422513157
the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had .	220350.48419742598
but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and , true to the maxim that every little irishman’s house is his castle , he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and ( alas to relate !	7209997.848241465
) the coveted castle too .	2.8897071126274723
needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends .	94.87395164987623
come here , tommy , his sister called imperatively .	10.29754112920212
at once !	1
and you , jacky , for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand .	88.79759556429175
wait till i catch you for that .	3.8351454689625455
his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins .	1079.3806662128884
and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure .	16.718657599916234
his little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit .	778623.7403825938
still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him , her eyes dancing in admonition .	4091281.2211309806
nasty bold jacky !	1.4187712718752075
she cried .	1
she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly	15.36421884605413
what’s your name ?	1.310169112694974
butter and cream ?	1.4193204524501792
tell us who is your sweetheart , spoke edy boardman .	16.6359073845582
is cissy your sweetheart ?	2.0062777857838077
nao , tearful tommy said .	2.8866962015260684
is edy boardman your sweetheart ?	2.839331619230209
cissy queried .	1
nao , tommy said .	1.8580403945540889
i know , edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes .	118.84141519151163
i know who is tommy’s sweetheart .	3.412136402634943
gerty is tommy’s sweetheart .	1.856837631037231
nao , tommy said on the verge of tears .	9.470249127102637
cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes .	76618.99908380356
but who was gerty ?	2.0069210507796207
gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions , lost in thought , gazing far away into the distance was , in very truth , as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see .	362306.38290406513
she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though , as folks often said , she was more a giltrap than a macdowell .	1829.4030384119346
her figure was slight and graceful , inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling .	17945797.564535074
the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupid’s bow , greekly perfect .	2498.9303592948027
her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either .	699068.3265818306
bertha supple told that once to edy boardman , a deliberate lie , when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty ( the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals ) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again .	2731209483.0059223
no .	1
honour where honour is due .	2.893391016880295
there was an innate refinement , a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep .	1194.714349956777
had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her .	8861165329.119606
mayhap it was this , the love that might have been , that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look , tense with suppressed meaning , that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes , a charm few could resist .	1528226.608634325
why have women such eyes of witchery ?	5.740087745034869
gerty’s were of the bluest irish blue , set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows .	176.85990936427817
time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive .	16.378264115214172
it was madame vera verity , directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette , who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes , so becoming in leaders of fashion , and she had never regretted it .	3354522.710489406
then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose ?	1295.6657649518554
that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one .	19.030117456970572
but gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair .	16.585391688697722
it was dark brown with a natural wave in it .	16.65431861534629
she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too , thursday for wealth .	59702.31801153116
and just now at edy’s words as a telltale flush , delicate as the faintest rosebloom , crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god’s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal .	1845585.0586351347
for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes .	18.90961618780254
she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue .	38.17239420828682
inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent .	23.83984106923875
the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning .	14230.812602175292
she knew right well , no-one better , what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel .	6947.405529893958
as per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window .	12318.03542285191
only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w. e. wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university .	125208877.85370454
little recked he perhaps for what she felt , that dull aching void in her heart sometimes , piercing to the core .	977.4915934522033
yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time .	57.68884806548506
they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph .	1506.4877306861576
but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked , every inch a gentleman , the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden .	1305096726301549.8
gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out .	6724.32591114086
a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes ( because it was expected in the lady’s pictorial that electric blue would be worn ) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket ( in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit ) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection .	90158798056.40733
she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone .	23115.628686486012
all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery’s summer sales , the very it , slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice , seven fingers two and a penny .	998002.8997970907
she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then , smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her !	17280.71525834991
and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew .	2063.6914258623215
her shoes were the newest thing in footwear ( edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell , a five , and never would ash , oak or elm ) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep .	20185133.682754077
her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops .	39648.90370902924
as for undies they were gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen ( though gerty would never see seventeen again ) can find it in his heart to blame her ?	201871.9661614355
she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery , three garments and nighties extra , and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons , rosepink , pale blue , mauve and peagreen , and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things .	53360221207.62687
she was wearing the blue for luck , hoping against hope , her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a friday .	1.0960822248483818e+16
and yet and yet !	2.006777419513476
that strained look on her face !	3.358188627736967
a gnawing sorrow is there all the time .	8.097158978209377
her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where , giving way to tears , she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror .	16973247.668371335
you are lovely , gerty , it said .	7.434773593901965
the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful .	47.49225639234242
gerty macdowell yearns in vain .	2.9060189917076245
yes , she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t. c. d. ( because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie ) and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be .	3575619040.247194
he was too young to understand .	3.5789125568212503
he would not believe in love , a woman’s birthright .	12.983423542877768
the night of the party long ago in stoer’s ( he was still in short trousers ) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips .	49989.88926953195
he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss ( the first !	233.47124865087196
) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments .	461.0861331143597
impetuous fellow !	1
strength of character had never been reggy wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men .	2124.2250195028223
but waiting , always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over .	239.10849073195476
no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal , perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey , and who would understand , take her in his sheltering arms , strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss .	34057061173.439022
it would be like heaven .	2.26671563892773
for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve .	16.382890423322266
with all the heart of her she longs to be his only , his affianced bride for riches for poor , in sickness in health , till death us two part , from this to this day forward .	170577.29035253305
and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be .	11355.745588889187
then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face , bertha supple too , and edy , little spitfire , because she would be twentytwo in november .	14750.611504400134
she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess .	2848.9925732744828
her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire , dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction , then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltrap’s lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses .	1.1099245737193025e+20
he would be tall with broad shoulders ( she had always admired tall men for a husband ) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon ( three wonderful weeks !	861221.719982755
) and then , when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house , every morning they would both have brekky , simple but perfectly served , for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes .	1164381859.1846616
edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight .	526934.8222330898
but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground , if you please .	6324205.868911821
the temper of him !	2.0092135501328268
o , he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies .	87.34532633912477
edy told him no , no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him .	797.7740593373279
you’re not my sister , naughty tommy said .	8.311772920018432
it’s my ball .	1.4435176575535114
but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up , look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career , having won the day .	464531.52508935594
anything for a quiet life , laughed ciss .	8.316215632273307
and she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor , here’s his two horses , here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in , chinchopper , chinchopper , chinchopper chin .	208194.6527678843
but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him .	693.3527731859998
i’d like to give him something , she said , so i would , where i won’t say .	120.69642710301287
on the beeoteetom , laughed cissy merrily .	5.87853728997097
gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say , flushing a deep rosy red , and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said .	6121475.94510376
but not a pin cared ciss .	4.083119107083392
let him !	1
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose .	92.79853771727137
give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at him .	79.91267358427025
madcap ciss with her golliwog curls .	4.094339641295742
you had to laugh at her sometimes .	4.099229449492338
for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white .	371619739.6210911
that was just like cissycums .	2.889737642111767
o , and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road , smoking a cigarette .	30577.62676104745
there was none to come up to her for fun .	11.044290092264891
but she was sincerity itself , one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made , not one of your twofaced things , too sweet to be wholesome .	6031.660334632759
and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ .	307.22267278031103
it was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner , the reverend john hughes s. j. , rosary , sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament .	2976.206211310837
they were there gathered together without distinction of social class ( and a most edifying spectacle it was to see ) in that simple fane beside the waves , after the storms of this weary world , kneeling before the feet of the immaculate , reciting the litany of our lady of loreto , beseeching her to intercede for them , the old familiar words , holy mary , holy virgin of virgins .	25467140770.76428
how sad to poor gerty’s ears !	4.014253036827009
had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink , by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearson’s weekly , she might now be rolling in her carriage , second to none .	366785.8826338266
over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket , thinking .	4735599.121892276
but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days .	532.0029290367655
nay , she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father , a prey to the fumes of intoxication , forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness , deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low .	14944447409.706799
and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful , virgin most merciful .	136.52210131022676
and gerty , rapt in thought , scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk .	1717161.2853437846
you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face ( it was a palpable case of doctor fell ) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose .	285205750.85849166
poor father !	1
with all his faults she loved him still when he sang tell me , mary , how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried , god have mercy on him , from a stroke .	2387276794.2236543
her mother’s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken .	52423.446912771426
no-one would have thought the end was so near .	10.75959949508928
now he was laid to rest .	4.104683459727167
and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino , artistic , standard designs , fit for a palace , gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home .	26592793857.285786
a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house , a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold .	6085.25353906019
and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about , taking snuff .	2236189.0211893427
everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways .	15.31133997988537
it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac , the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window .	120723646451.46992
you could see there was a story behind it .	8.72399473873999
the colours were done something lovely .	4.084935056352425
she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat .	1006.8789100288136
she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant .	106747344.97830477
the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks .	1154648.459063793
needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball .	43195.07012314839
our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please .	1935.0721350247466
the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock .	174271.56849576827
the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed .	10358814.293200837
if you fail try again , edy boardman said .	10.499105531013088
gerty smiled assent and bit her lip .	5.85073139558017
a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle .	49734768.04841747
pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking .	154.0026163803703
she felt the warm flush , a danger signal always with gerty macdowell , surging and flaming into her cheeks .	450.4177519798803
till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight , wan and strangely drawn , seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen .	13949939.263667522
through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin , spiritual vessel , pray for us , honourable vessel , pray for us , vessel of singular devotion , pray for us , mystical rose .	9487613.883825613
and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered , their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary , the most pious virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her .	149027731560.2661
the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers .	314.21148735540453
cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee , clapping baby hands in air .	175.6455111137369
peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah !	2959.7107054333164
and , my word , didn’t the little chap enjoy that !	23.48108091126539
and then she told him to say papa .	5.588596784020402
say papa , baby .	2.0396143274239087
say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa .	6.176874725505441
and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health , a perfect little bunch of love , and he would certainly turn out to be something great , they said .	4176594.1812389614
haja ja ja haja .	2.0414565120591095
cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out , holy saint denis , that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him .	10854272.242059663
of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it	169.54677193613628
habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa .	1.4435178964393902
and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks .	23.19469021187241
it was all no use soothering him with no , nono , baby , no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss , always readywitted , gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased .	5892058.9897843
gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves , no hour to be out , and the little brats of twins .	19371.098039408633
she gazed out towards the distant sea .	5.078090018210797
it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out , the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft .	2013528314.662332
and while she gazed her heart went pitapat .	8.193146470119709
yes , it was her he was looking at , and there was meaning in his look .	76.53306608557683
his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through , read her very soul .	341.6733728190155
wonderful eyes they were , superbly expressive , but could you trust them ?	39.75001399140633
people were so queer .	2.0415119727666036
she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner , the image of the photo she had of martin harvey , the matinee idol , only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting .	367023703125.8295
he was in deep mourning , she could see that , and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face .	434.3348508529631
she would have given worlds to know what it was .	10.755696796785308
he was looking up so intently , so still , and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down .	201792.46721806144
she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away .	1282.9204772751827
here was that of which she had so often dreamed .	12.14284853465073
it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else .	1822.9105658266585
the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him , her dreamhusband , because she knew on the instant it was him .	848.2859070848406
if he had suffered , more sinned against than sinning , or even , even , if he had been himself a sinner , a wicked man , she cared not .	9109.48202688482
even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her .	168.63384903491902
there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm .	8.22987963991475
she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known , those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all , to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her , make him forget the memory of the past .	24414513.454918038
then mayhap he would embrace her gently , like a real man , crushing her soft body to him , and love her , his ownest girlie , for herself alone .	10840.899993061303
refuge of sinners .	1.4435178964393902
comfortress of the afflicted .	2.041449047943632
ora pro nobis .	1.3945350514397867
well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart .	1291611.6227426582
gerty could picture the whole scene in the church , the stained glass windows lighted up , the candles , the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin’s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o’hanlon at the altar , carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down .	13466506.243266897
he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic .	6604385.992517909
he told her that time when she told him about that in confession , crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see , not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws , he said , in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god , he said , and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word .	5619040703960.092
he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place .	24585432310535.05
the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it .	1846.4688896975667
little monkeys common as ditchwater .	2.8919603135745904
someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places , the both of them .	1799.26709705683
and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned .	1601.0040756451908
jacky !	1
tommy !	1
not they !	1
what a great notion they had !	3.6870756427439653
so cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out .	35.1117950049903
she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him , tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it .	1876547338.434977
she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible .	130616685802.85751
it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble .	57902.98243442124
tableau !	1
that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness .	57.583136917318875
queen of angels , queen of patriarchs , queen of prophets , of all saints , they prayed , queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o’hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o’hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the tantumer gosa cramen tum .	2.2118582303507842e+21
three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrow’s of george’s street on the tuesday , no the monday before easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at , transparent , and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form ( the cheek of her !	100602044.88320746
) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself .	45.777488635576034
cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature .	376594551.96164346
gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier , a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders a radiant little vision , in sooth , almost maddening in its sweetness .	558740.2065756589
you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that .	432.82011962231525
she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve .	358.1501307468565
she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes .	21937.735378960748
he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey .	15.161863200160063
her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose .	65566.68857010649
edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty , half smiling , with her specs like an old maid , pretending to nurse the baby .	8476.873665427516
irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers .	7980.508910963838
and she said to gerty	1.7048093327281617
a penny for your thoughts .	2.5189721271093743
what ?	1
replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth .	21.835299884256145
i was only wondering was it late .	5.3215719337006
because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late .	33206.13186568897
and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy , as glib as you like , said it was half past kissing time , time to kiss again .	19396.341482575877
but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early .	31.07738870830851
wait , said cissy , i’ll run ask my uncle peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum .	336.10449979020336
so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket , getting nervous , and beginning to play with his watchchain , looking up at the church .	108478.3442777377
passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself .	51.647975428844894
one moment he had been there , fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze , and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman , selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure .	52386.84653158159
cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch , listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set .	99605259.21041049
his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones .	2941.6531865683096
cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order .	462.46740634144857
then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon o’hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time .	33331422811.706112
it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets .	122061.00092861755
she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon .	3815861.140572712
his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour , literally worshipping at her shrine .	306.6179604493286
if ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face .	703.0921254334686
it is for you , gertrude macdowell , and you know it .	17.88508603184611
edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over .	7.883281578139582e+19
gerty winced sharply .	1.4435176705843038
a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable .	66.57487881835797
it hurt o yes , it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was .	14743.86097664729
gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat , so slim , so flawless , so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of .	275662.8215876656
she had loved him better than he knew .	6.316797820080263
lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears .	14852.701077041493
their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see .	5727.4811816491165
o , responded gerty , quick as lightning , laughing , and the proud head flashed up .	126.38804320853049
i can throw my cap at who i like because it’s leap year .	46.52088661014677
her words rang out crystalclear , more musical than the cooing of the ringdove , but they cut the silence icily .	738.2036282308713
there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with .	330.3574477156067
as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces .	3616446.525219873
and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot .	2906.3734941289167
miss puny little edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it , the little kinnatt , because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof , apart , in another sphere , that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it .	49715404062528.56
edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior .	118464.51599529648
and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky , laughing up out of his gleeful eyes , and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby , without as much as by your leave , sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib .	9491698408.613003
o my !	1
puddeny pie !	1
protested ciss .	1
he has his bib destroyed .	2.6475484978274966
the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights .	175.6194966270579
gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon o’hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands .	13267969555481.955
how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight , the last glimpse of erin , the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk , hither , thither , with a tiny lost cry .	3557062.7540410273
and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins , author of mabel vaughan and other tales .	9050582990520.783
for gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of .	11.744365952428634
she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which , though it did not err on the side of luxury , was scrupulously neat and clean .	36780489.68426527
it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove , the tortoiseshell combs , her child of mary badge , the whiterose scent , the eyebrowleine , her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely’s of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs .	342773267912679.94
art thou real , my ideal ?	4.090408149776534
it was called by louis j walsh , magherafelt , and after there was something about twilight , wilt thou ever ?	679.2861897721905
and ofttimes the beauty of poetry , so sad in its transient loveliness , had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her , one by one , and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it .	1898873840.33173
but it must end , she felt .	5.883402769637838
if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her .	128.77342030373654
love laughs at locksmiths .	2.0414457490622087
she would make the great sacrifice .	4.1315082115322035
her every effort would be to share his thoughts .	11.66740777525916
dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness .	113.09855532367074
there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse , cruel only to be kind .	14244593.729937112
but even if what then ?	2.8394700885384294
would it make a very great difference ?	4.805273956415432
from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled .	18.677577159001896
she loathed that sort of person , the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour , degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station .	1562908.8064628395
no , no not that .	2.2081090573898416
they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess .	5251.6642699991635
perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall .	69.86489761460014
she thought she understood .	1.8721299437922516
she would try to understand him because men were so different .	23.344841796738717
the old love was waiting , waiting with little white hands stretched out , with blue appealing eyes .	253.03492348312693
heart of mine !	1.418510180958278
she would follow , her dream of love , the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all , the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide .	105057.64738181453
nothing else mattered .	1.4435178964393902
come what might she would be wild , untrammelled , free .	22.01056401323697
canon o’hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn’t she coming but jacky caffrey called out	22660279.38101045
o , look , cissy !	2.0782877647832727
and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church , blue and then green and purple .	2506.1589487879373
it’s fireworks , cissy caffrey said .	3.781716311133736
and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church , helterskelter , edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running .	216728.20321474338
come on , gerty , cissy called .	3.897191139854989
it’s the bazaar fireworks .	2.0414825402449455
but gerty was adamant .	2.041446156494422
she had no intention of being at their beck and call .	21.697090171462747
if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was .	303.2404664324233
the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling .	20.266200279499866
she looked at him a moment , meeting his glance , and a light broke in upon her .	167.19483646390546
whitehot passion was in that face , passion silent as the grave , and it had made her his .	274.1042718954346
at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death , steadfast , a sterling man , a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips .	270736.1091872118
his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her .	28.095287742278217
she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that , supply soft and delicately rounded , and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart , his hoarse breathing , because she knew too about the passion of men like that , hotblooded , because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed .	1.7997356977430426e+20
but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips .	103072.22349752384
besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too , my dear , and winny rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did .	40219419206.02266
and jacky caffrey shouted to look , there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look , look , there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air , a soft thing , to and fro , dark .	1254312770.5213323
and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees , up , up , and , in the tense hush , they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it , high , high , almost out of sight , and her face was suffused with a divine , an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too , nainsook knickers , the fabric that caresses the skin , better than those other pettiwidth , the green , four and eleven , on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking , looking .	5.9854026470895876e+29
she would fain have cried to him chokingly , held out her snowy slender arms to him to come , to feel his lips laid on her white brow , the cry of a young girl’s love , a little strangled cry , wrung from her , that cry that has rung through the ages .	54392219.9514737
and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o !	32.779005045846624
then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o !	28.635731652354547
and everyone cried o !	2.006625445783444
o !	1
in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah !	413.57459539188955
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden , o so lovely , o , soft , sweet , soft !	534.8924433506883
then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent .	30.672297070903003
ah !	1
she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly , a pathetic little glance of piteous protest , of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl .	7233.853523721609
he was leaning back against the rock behind .	8.272875066749005
leopold bloom ( for it is he ) stands silent , with bowed head before those young guileless eyes .	322.77172955734704
what a brute he had been !	3.5923486357813803
at it again ?	1.4193191745886715
a fair unsullied soul had called to him and , wretch that he was , how had he answered ?	214.8197432672909
an utter cad he had been !	3.592350119376169
he of all men !	2.0068702340859432
but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes , for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered .	5739.712869205249
should a girl tell ?	2.0075766167594864
no , a thousand times no .	4.0862466531417665
that was their secret , only theirs , alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell .	252019.568102135
cissy caffrey whistled , imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried	809.8699114372251
gerty !	1
gerty !	1
we’re going .	1
come on .	1

gerty had an idea , one of love’s little ruses .	13.796311139438009
she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back .	4191.243246411412
wonder if he’s too far to .	4.1136642421668475
she rose .	1
was it goodbye ?	1.4193199133965113
no .	1
she had to go but they would meet again , there , and she would dream of that till then , tomorrow , of her dream of yester eve .	6583.438834163617
she drew herself up to her full height .	7.180503878254291
their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart , full of a strange shining , hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face .	8869.63463895623
she half smiled at him wanly , a sweet forgiving smile , a smile that verged on tears , and then they parted .	1185.6671664499827
slowly , without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy , to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey , to little baby boardman .	3032.2818557149803
it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed .	197.32913458018362
she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because because gerty macdowell was.. .	594.9846401448272

i dreamt .	1
what ?	1
worst is beginning .	1.4435175334469474
how they change the venue when it’s not what they like .	21.55108834446954
ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who .	46.72728778482301
or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped .	81.62995094984234
yet if i went the whole hog , say i want to , something like that .	83.73245483118508
because i did .	1.442941181759722
she too .	1
offend her .	1
then make it up .	1.9520054104924698
pretend to want something awfully , then cry off for her sake .	30.46719675859555
flatters them .	1
she must have been thinking of someone else all the time .	15.6804798690942
what harm ?	1
must since she came to the use of reason , he , he and he .	60.33376665564095
first kiss does the trick .	2.654074740604696
the propitious moment .	1.443517561177601
something inside them goes pop .	2.887302367201496
mushy like , tell by their eye , on the sly .	15.287901647248505
first thoughts are best .	2.041754712482574
remember that till their dying day .	4.08929426643486
molly , lieutenant mulvey that kissed her under the moorish wall beside the gardens .	67.34688968923345
fifteen she told me .	2.0185714509725483
but her breasts were developed .	2.8891109651001545
fell asleep then .	1.4435176169263444
after glencree dinner that was when we drove home .	10.674669342341643
featherbed mountain .	1
gnashing her teeth in sleep .	2.9069255543849395
lord mayor had his eye on her too .	8.25448489160683
val dillon .	1
apoplectic .	1
there she is with them down there for the fireworks .	12.066019565412736
my fireworks .	1
up like a rocket , down like a stick .	9.137882490923278
and the children , twins they must be , waiting for something to happen .	49.18755200170437
want to be grownups .	1.5946190108396374
dressing in mother’s clothes .	2.0415566955593634
time enough , understand all the ways of the world .	15.795556560157287
and the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth .	28.588668897298085
i knew she could whistle .	2.8879917850080052
mouth made for that .	2.0462178896454333
like molly .	1
why that highclass whore in jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose .	47.0690152476319
would you mind , please , telling me the right time ?	19.167909285658286
i’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane .	12.229706701849974
say prunes and prisms forty times every morning , cure for fat lips .	47.212700434547216
caressing the little boy too .	2.889917503696638
onlookers see most of the game .	3.908632304902053
of course they understand birds , animals , babies .	11.966962836773384
in their line .	1.312965850257855
didn’t look back when she was going down the strand .	11.837885057920792
wouldn’t give that satisfaction .	2.0414532090496276
those girls , those girls , those lovely seaside girls .	7.376875790055063
fine eyes she had , clear .	4.154996160958481
it’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil .	51.517175140289474
did she know what i ?	2.212415766830995
course .	1
like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump .	8.218517736028055
women never meet one like that wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of venus with all his belongings on show .	651.680770459427
call that innocence ?	1.4193212175477754
poor idiot !	1
his wife has her work cut out for her .	11.6576912093972
never see them sit on a bench marked wet paint .	15.127426597528764
eyes all over them .	2.0434923039009973
look under the bed for what’s not there .	8.189067892001223
longing to get the fright of their lives .	6.4099184890501455
sharp as needles they are .	2.8915477135925216
when i said to molly the man at the corner of cuffe street was goodlooking , thought she might like , twigged at once he had a false arm .	5533.12391500703
had , too .	1.443517521193017
where do they get that ?	2.492644356010662
typist going up roger greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings .	53.56635306369701
handed down from father to , mother to daughter , i mean .	34.3874441413609
bred in the bone .	1.8589471328640317
milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing .	43.894134648431105
best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror .	43.825212568130596
and when i sent her for molly’s paisley shawl to prescott’s by the way that ad i must , carrying home the change in her stocking !	2918.6958944077405
clever little minx .	1.4435178964393902
i never told her .	2.0455292896631576
neat way she carries parcels too .	4.08657029156008
attract men , small thing like that .	5.170087545423276
holding up her hand , shaking it , to let the blood flow back when it was red .	142.25942548091345
who did you learn that from ?	4.037277557613163
nobody .	1
something the nurse taught me .	2.89069609865957
o , don’t they know !	2.2726491650642773
three years old she was in front of molly’s dressingtable , just before we left lombard street west .	155.8681296083732
me have a nice pace .	2.8873568881304337
mullingar .	1
who knows ?	1
ways of the world .	2.0771093430432526
young student .	1
straight on her pins anyway not like the other .	10.30124907842221
still she was game .	2.041514217373986
lord , i am wet .	2.021079344418715
devil you are .	1.4413808905589327
swell of her calf .	2.041473023707536
transparent stockings , stretched to breaking point .	5.330410549797985
not like that frump today .	2.37174442599402
a. e. rumpled stockings .	2.0415296891206527
or the one in grafton street .	3.6270576818290667
white .	1
wow !	1
beef to the heel .	2.0058158879359507
a monkey puzzle rocket burst , spluttering in darting crackles .	16.74783477973626
zrads and zrads , zrads , zrads .	5.514750160598326
and cissy and tommy and jacky ran out to see and edy after with the pushcar and then gerty beyond the curve of the rocks .	1554.340445646083
will she ?	1

off colour after kiernan’s , dignam’s .	4.156105995880248
for this relief much thanks .	2.362374956911484
in hamlet that is .	2.0431421729393464
lord !	1
it was all things combined .	2.5127312520063616
excitement .	1
when she leaned back , felt an ache at the butt of my tongue .	51.69801026096927
your head it simply swirls .	2.0900897433007692
he’s right .	1
might have made a worse fool of myself however .	10.766453468075824
instead of talking about nothing .	2.8900866420247424
then i will tell you all .	2.8483626847801453
still it was a kind of language between us .	6.1843958792302
it couldn’t be ?	1.419319877050783
no , gerty they called her .	4.098814936384
might be false name however like my name and the address dolphin’s barn a blind .	94.93093688682615
her maiden name was jemina brown and she lived with her mother in irishtown .	67.19536608866754
place made me think of that i suppose .	7.009231020130147
all tarred with the same brush .	3.7883839829322787
wiping pens in their stockings .	2.8904696281826108
but the ball rolled down to her as if it understood .	18.169504056944866
every bullet has its billet .	2.8879430711646488
course i never could throw anything straight at school .	11.578940537079033
crooked as a ram’s horn .	2.8871238549436837
sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah .	170362.82410531354
no soft job .	1.4435176568953885
saves them .	1
keeps them out of harm’s way .	3.2832397865398706
nature .	1
washing child , washing corpse .	2.887166195543567
dignam .	1
children’s hands always round them .	2.8874374377474874
cocoanut skulls , monkeys , not even closed at first , sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds .	311.90364798353164
oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck .	19.64067253303096
fill it up with wind .	2.8964096132723918
mrs beaufoy , purefoy .	2.041519269058011
must call to the hospital .	2.508506701952245
wonder is nurse callan there still .	4.084007621499849
she used to look over some nights when molly was in the coffee palace .	35.56759345769012
that young doctor o’hare i noticed her brushing his coat .	16.464711465969472
and mrs breen and mrs dignam once like that too , marriageable .	33.76853222292782
worst of all at night mrs duggan told me in the city arms .	34.73393102758804
husband rolling in drunk , stink of pub off him like a polecat .	35.20544902112611
have that in your nose in the dark , whiff of stale boose .	34.34484920180773
then ask in the morning was i drunk last night ?	13.047512610335499
bad policy however to fault the husband .	5.880189290860199
chickens come home to roost .	2.663461158025871
they stick by one another like glue .	5.786149709285034
maybe the women’s fault also .	2.887547172295494
that’s where molly can knock spots off them .	8.1838337619257
it’s the blood of the south .	2.7029134570087257
moorish .	1
also the form , the figure .	3.8446851160856452
hands felt for the opulent .	2.424802929759194
just compare for instance those others .	4.084904539233919
wife locked up at home , skeleton in the cupboard .	16.926360959084978
allow me to introduce my .	2.8899233818896186
then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript , wouldn’t know what to call her .	113.14145887566423
always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife .	11.674315013860932
still there’s destiny in it , falling in love .	10.035401473815316
have their own secrets between them .	4.083487314952308
chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand .	74.83909204148779
then little chits of girls , height of a shilling in coppers , with little hubbies .	118.12529442262853
as god made them he matched them .	5.335089629643872
sometimes children turn out well enough .	4.090652219691503
twice nought makes one .	2.0434011957731997
or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride .	11.789669295901568
marry in may and repent in december .	5.876618533142782
this wet is very unpleasant .	2.8878431122711947
stuck .	1
well the foreskin is not back .	4.091399449500682
better detach .	1
ow !	1
other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket .	18.834798402733433
long and the short of it .	4.129518070449598
big he and little she .	2.8920542961386593
very strange about my watch .	2.8901819958356687
wristwatches are always going wrong .	2.887983205482547
wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he .	114.19255084524501
yes , i suppose , at once .	4.505429426110244
cat’s away , the mice will play .	5.845854525269887
i remember looking in pill lane .	4.113325643389987
also that now is magnetism .	2.892941334710074
back of everything magnetism .	2.041454680476339
earth for instance pulling this and being pulled .	8.258138019794886
that causes movement .	1.4435177424497432
and time , well that’s the time the movement takes .	15.329360741331076
then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit .	46.89025264462371
because it’s all arranged .	2.0414587144120757
magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun , the stars .	25.486459681398458
little piece of steel iron .	2.8872532663229276
when you hold out the fork .	4.137376708572581
come .	1
come .	1
tip .	1
woman and man that is .	2.7813415354264386
fork and steel .	1.4435177227067193
molly , he .	1.4400418650861448
dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and , like a sneeze coming , legs , look , look and if you have any guts in you .	614578.8218815431
tip .	1
have to let fly .	1.95986970547725
wonder how is she feeling in that region .	6.9667225911725765
shame all put on before third person .	5.7971983278474974
more put out about a hole in her stocking .	9.933178445686021
molly , her underjaw stuck out , head back , about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show .	1052.2755949145917
and when the painters were in lombard street west .	6.277135938757872
fine voice that fellow had .	2.4344896893415866
how giuglini began .	1.443517441951814
smell that i did .	2.041347828440268
like flowers .	1
it was too .	1.394532255662013
violets .	1
came from the turpentine probably in the paint .	6.629046329539252
make their own use of everything .	4.125377240241056
same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear .	47.62873201027137
but lots of them can’t kick the beam , i think .	19.460179891689773
keep that thing up for hours .	4.102308687958178
kind of a general all round over me and half down my back .	35.87278102826884
wait .	1
hm .	1
hm .	1
yes .	1
that’s her perfume .	1.4435175371138302
why she waved her hand .	2.6546076642170857
i leave you this to think of me when i’m far away on the pillow .	64.40857859861836
what is it ?	1.239447462923871
heliotrope ?	1
no .	1
hyacinth ?	1
hm .	1
roses , i think .	1.914496429429896
she’d like scent of that kind .	4.136361424891278
sweet and cheap soon sour .	2.8872973402917763
why molly likes opoponax .	2.041448122307915
suits her , with a little jessamine mixed .	5.050485199412426
her high notes and her low notes .	5.850645537031023
at the dance night she met him , dance of the hours .	29.340642218671846
heat brought it out .	2.0403839245275592
she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before .	55.60990907136889
good conductor , is it ?	2.3886007722849785
or bad ?	1
light too .	1
suppose there’s some connection .	2.0414552178097165
for instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark .	23.324662312922385
mysterious thing too .	1.443517521193017
why did i smell it only now ?	4.959628920751865
took its time in coming like herself , slow but sure .	23.74173781153176
suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across .	23.36146088405497
yes , it is .	2.067443609095662
because those spice islands , cinghalese this morning , smell them leagues off .	40.273335405414784
tell you what it is .	2.30478277303925
it’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin , fine like what do you call it gossamer , and they’re always spinning it out of them , fine as anything , like rainbow colours without knowing it .	627458.7339995762
clings to everything she takes off .	4.091728752817251
vamp of her stockings .	2.0415203180156425
warm shoe .	1
stays .	1
drawers little kick , taking them off .	5.521775975059813
byby till next time .	2.0384996536220985
also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed .	26.288381311193895
know her smell in a thousand .	3.998543472214286
bathwater too .	1
reminds me of strawberries and cream .	3.7783659808459915
wonder where it is really .	2.8934937894527146
there or the armpits or under the neck .	8.273375881500513
because you get it out of all holes and corners .	9.046214382402411
hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something .	11.793194954572172
muskrat .	1
bag under their tails .	2.0414812838603287
one grain pour off odour for years .	5.798071744117843
dogs at each other behind .	2.513700793552824
good evening .	1
evening .	1
how do you sniff ?	1.519565280187275
hm .	1
hm .	1
very well , thank you .	2.2722821920871596
animals go by that .	2.048148678854674
yes now , look at it that way .	5.148647034389944
we’re the same .	1.4417542285312304
some women , instance , warn you off when they have their period .	43.47624180444938
come near .	1
then get a hogo you could hang your hat on .	16.443134175809444
like what ?	1
potted herrings gone stale or .	2.891122623445257
boof !	1
please keep off the grass .	2.9210047392908396
perhaps they get a man smell off us .	8.229670067935707
what though ?	1
cigary gloves long john had on his desk the other day .	19.109231062363293
breath ?	1
what you eat and drink gives that .	5.855401733000891
no .	1
mansmell , i mean .	2.0430487540673274
must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different .	61.23514345866794
women buzz round it like flies round treacle .	8.200638752901886
railed off the altar get on to it at any cost .	23.434355641620208
the tree of forbidden priest .	2.8872041587597623
o , father , will you ?	2.433529672393869

and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice .	57617535947.61113
and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there .	435.20117349896003
and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile .	189.58068099240282
also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility .	6346.18247625343
but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle .	8372.349141607196
and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery .	5208.914738874583
and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment .	24078.613502437605
and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously .	205405.63608656765
and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles .	29429.453810830153
and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer .	305.48101023721097
and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so .	306067.9599820364
and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress .	5871.284024478623
and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain .	2990595.29682553
and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead .	17995.922556875623
and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each .	1830.1847789943236
and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile .	25084525.2494409
and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile .	52.81777206433375
thanked be almighty god .	2.0386904852296235
this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child , a gentle dame , whose time hied fast .	490408.98361772805
sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel , said he , that it be not come or now .	71158.23102359683
meseems it dureth overlong .	2.041449039073887
and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently .	5016059.817205571
but , said he , or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long .	12375.504840467951
and the franklin that had drunken said , expecting each moment to be her next .	82.64267677623937
also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and , now drink , said he , fully delectably , and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness .	19148093.660277832
and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup .	22406257.671092868
woman’s woe with wonder pondering .	2.887190757962619
now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might .	359.553420953834
there was a sort of scholars along either side the board , that is to wit , dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable’s with other his fellows lynch and madden , scholars of medicine , and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa , one crotthers , and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested ( and of all them , reserved young stephen , he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead ) and beside the meek sir leopold .	5355131716659432.0
but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow .	5388.856952904102
and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner .	1472604.2271177238
ruth red him , love led on with will to wander , loth to leave .	97.79844128809789
for they were right witty scholars .	4.084093329228886
and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness , young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die ( for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case ) .	78550157313.3238
and they said farther she should live because in the beginning , they said , the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die .	1584944.6800514492
and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy .	984867.7532574207
a redress god grant .	2.0414496458811167
this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay , by our virgin mother , the wife should live and the babe to die .	3962.3950441145157
in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack .	405121.6734762983
then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved .	33287707.82367759
to whom young stephen had these words following murmur , sirs , is eke oft among lay folk .	249.71590115200578
both babe and parent now glorify their maker , the one in limbo gloom , the other in purgefire .	284.7308013310494
but , gramercy , what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise , which is the sin against the holy ghost , very god , lord and giver of life ?	16819.46246673181
for , sirs , he said , our lust is brief .	16.121949259603973
we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we .	133.21480438602842
then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends .	23.332078919878942
but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead .	1229502.1377266198
whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn , the other all this while , pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him , witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do .	4048221277.2193065
thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever .	1417005.0319381861
then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom , of law of canons , of lilith , patron of abortions , of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or , as virgilius saith , by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with , effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides .	31160007111122.27
he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal , even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded .	12786858888.473623
all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life .	1531.6310934359208
a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and , laying hand to jaw , he said dissembling , as his wont was , that as it was informed him , who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman , and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions .	581084059408.0139
that is truth , pardy , said dixon , and , or i err , a pregnant word .	220.18457954305893
which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons .	825994.3247233023
but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny .	928810990.4287829
and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool , the flower of the flock , lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled ( for it was then about the midst of the winter ) and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage ( for all accounted him of real parts ) so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores .	4.2424352527474437e+18
about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who , praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff , he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray .	2581298754.857066
now drink we , quod he , of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment .	6384.985690557673
leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone .	33.428975415823025
be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay .	164.2369446466029
see ye here .	1.4435175085438716
and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had , he said , for a song which he writ .	14794.399552258605
they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore .	104.14519984351062
his words were then these as followeth know all men , he said , time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions .	257.1542845745818
what means this ?	1.4193199722944616
desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time .	599.0065528137003
mark me now .	1.4417681086876892
in woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away .	3291.5935269107704
this is the postcreation .	1.5946216409400582
omnis caro ad te veniet .	2.362642707756684
no question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our agenbuyer , healer and herd , our mighty mother and mother most venerable and bernardus saith aptly that she hath an omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem that is to wit , an almightiness of petition because she is the second eve and she won us , saith augustine too , whereas that other , our grandam , which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all , seed , breed and generation , for a penny pippin .	40140248797624.6
but here is the matter now .	3.796399797961223
or she knew him , that second i say , and was but creature of her creature , vergine madre , figlia di tuo figlio or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with peter piscator who lives in the house that jack built and with joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages , parceque m. léo taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichue position c’était le sacré pigeon , ventre de dieu !	2089532867070.18
entweder transubstantiality oder consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality .	11.65175434005096
and all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word .	18.700268207711506
a pregnancy without joy , he said , a birth without pangs , a body without blemish , a belly without bigness .	659.0139795349152
let the lewd with faith and fervour worship .	7.582736956882497
with will will we withstand , withsay .	5.880563335806026
hereupon punch costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch staboo stabella about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in almany which he did straightways now attack the first three months she was not well , staboo when here nurse quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard .	227288383979886.44
it was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking , in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage , nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently punch costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him , a murrain seize the dolt , what a devil he would be at , thou chuff , thou puny , thou got in peasestraw , thou losel , thou chitterling , thou spawn of a rebel , thou dykedropt , thou abortion thou , to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of god ape , the good sir leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet , margerain gentle , advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred .	1.8130265093615615e+23
in horne’s house rest should reign .	3.4351027084064945
to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles , goodly grinning , asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb , chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days .	48787895.46388114
master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how , as he heard hereof counted , he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too , waxing merry and toasting to his fathership .	13651264.328160824
but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin .	410.49745763173115
thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses , as the priests use in madagascar island , she to be in guise of white and saffron , her groom in white and grain , with burning of nard and tapers , on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided .	171437635576.86176
he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets master john fletcher and master francis beaumont that is in their maid’s tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers to bed , to bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals .	54250447.50444774
an exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion .	6382.922125373667
well met they were , said master dixon , joyed , but , harkee , young sir , better were they named beau mount and lecher for , by my troth , of such a mingling much might come .	350288.4044761589
young stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it .	1491994.8662220095
greater love than this , he said , no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend .	470.79354978647945
go thou and do likewise .	2.8882605803232173
thus , or words to that effect , saith zarathustra , sometime regius professor of french letters to the university of oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden .	62886.28303444571
bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed .	172.37828459843425
orate , fratres , pro memetipso .	4.156014623874273
and all the people shall say , amen .	5.2951697085770455
remember , erin , thy generations and thy days of old , how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like jeshurum .	2278543.523802596
therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me , thy lord , to be the slave of servants .	566.3130819684751
return , return , clan milly forget me not , o milesian .	33.8356317383673
why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the roman and to the indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously ?	261037.1527095066
look forth now , my people , upon the land of behest , even from horeb and from nebo and from pisgah and from the horns of hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money .	53988.363005695006
but thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever .	379.39474398205164
and thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth .	2147.377596776748
this tenebrosity of the interior , he proceeded to say , hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the orient from on high which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous .	917199.2863954266
assuefaction minorates atrocities ( as tully saith of his darling stoics ) and hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion .	1562.113861097513
the adiaphane in the noon of life is an egypt’s plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper ubi and quomodo .	3932.775934531701
and as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals , that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being .	82693535.50775354
the aged sisters draw us into life we wail , batten , sport , clip , clasp , sunder , dwindle , die over us dead they bend .	9511.88308955346
first , saved from waters of old nile , among bulrushes , a bed of fasciated wattles at last the cavity of a mountain , an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage .	188374.08382989574
and as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to tophet or to edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness .	32321951.986588325
thereto punch costello roared out mainly etienne chanson but he loudly bid them , lo , wisdom hath built herself a house , this vast majestic longstablished vault , the crystal palace of the creator , all in applepie order , a penny for him who finds the pea .	8648883.478412736
behold the mansion reared by dedal jack see the malt stored in many a refluent sack , in the proud cirque of jackjohn’s bivouac .	1668.0413423103344
a black crack of noise in the street here , alack , bawled back .	46.5410722430572
loud on left thor thundered in anger awful the hammerhurler .	16.645502120667363
came now the storm that hist his heart .	8.226371885635226
and master lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry .	1568.6050962202187
and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm .	81407822.73020636
then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour .	296925.98104523803
but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead .	1923.4109326306266
but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in horne’s hall .	83.79193913563415
he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden , being godly certain whiles , knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom , at the braggart’s side , spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear , advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard , the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead , look you , having taken place , and all of the order of a natural phenomenon .	474869606641401.8
but was young boasthard’s fear vanquished by calmer’s words ?	11.3826012710637
no , for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away .	391.3910913445986
and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other ?	60.84890885160797
he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either .	34.24444161152404
but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal ?	1070.4063750407597
indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle .	23.390973261673764
heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or , what calmer said , a hubbub of phenomenon ?	823.4604672925832
heard ?	1
why , he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding ( which he had not done ) .	737.829820302327
for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show .	8011.435920896024
and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away ?	37.075399833681665
by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law .	21428.427216611388
then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe-on-me , that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it ?	17735560.54393848
yes , pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name , she said , is bird-in-the-hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as , ho , you pretty man , turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place , and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two-in-the-bush or , by some learned , carnal concupiscence .	666026636504847.9
this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird-in-the-hand ( which was within all foul plagues , monsters and a wicked devil ) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her .	124501507.45116402
for regarding believe-on-me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for , first , two-in-the-bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them , pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and , second , for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and , third , that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild .	5.823752572575449e+16

with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him ( for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it ) but on stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk .	2206684535.1547403
he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women , horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat .	6767.160977116081
to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps , ostlers , bookies , paul’s men , runners , flatcaps , waistcoateers , ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip .	28857693964.213226
he took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue , some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides .	562299364.5418851

there’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset .	11975423.378149563
mort aux vaches says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too .	20363.674719469695
from a child this frank had been a donought that his father , a headborough , who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes , matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes .	6451112616.107461
one time he would be a playactor , then a sutler or a welsher , then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main , then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk , kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge .	1385303064.1848183
he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him .	171894.1317111765

and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers , greasy hoggets and wether wool , having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe , a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low’s yard in prussia street .	36523504.83440688

mr stephen , a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality , that was sending over doctor rinderpest , the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy , with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns .	43983749.150458775
come , come , says mr vincent , plain dealing .	10.4663545054525
he’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s irish , says he .	482.3370480543768
irish by name and irish by nature , says mr stephen , and he sent the ale purling about , an irish bull in an english chinashop .	3739.4637303658847
i conceive you , says mr dixon .	4.586791809670134
it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas , the bravest cattlebreeder of them all , with an emerald ring in his nose .	7700.094345313124
true for you , says mr vincent cross the table , and a bullseye into the bargain , says he , and a plumper and a portlier bull , says he , never shit on shamrock .	26600.913676439137
he had horns galore , a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island , leaving doughballs and rollingpins , followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains .	433446.96233981336
what for that , says mr dixon , but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself .	50082.1883167095
so be off now , says he , and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing , and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly .	34473.94906869335
but the slap and the blessing stood him friend , says mr vincent , for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid , wife , abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland .	1403848630238.918
another then put in his word and they dressed him , says he , in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content .	120918631485.73083
by this time the father of the faithful ( for so they called him ) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture .	2688.9383858215274
to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him .	19021062.975519694
ay , says another , and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself ( for that was the only colour to his mind ) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice , saying by the lord harry , green is the grass that grows on the ground .	8692340271.271654
and , says mr dixon , if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry’s orders .	790807987.9672463
there was bad blood between them at first , says mr vincent , and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i’ll meddle in his matters , says he .	1939595.289793738
i’ll make that animal smell hell , says he , with the help of that good pizzle my father left me .	317.11138954458363
but one evening , says mr dixon , when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace ( he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks ) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans , bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show .	356031776946902.4
after that , says mr vincent , the lord harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name .	30421.996061310696
then , with the water running off him , he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy , the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat .	63552969627117.3
in short , he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt .	473.62541447797156
they were , says mr stephen , and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward , as the ungrate women were all of one mind , made a wherry raft , loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard , set all masts erect , manned the yards , sprang their luff , heaved to , spread three sheets in the wind , put her head between wind and water , weighed anchor , ported her helm , ran up the jolly roger , gave three times three , let the bullgine run , pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america .	5.658901516848625e+16
which was the occasion , says mr vincent , of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty	167.72117299015798

our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered , a young gentleman , his name alec bannon , who had late come to town , it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars .	982744081.9821297
mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on .	52765.27130964644
whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan .	20829.64466565758
fertiliser and incubator .	1.4435178964393902
lambay island .	1
his project , as he went on to expound , was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed .	14307643.208984947
well , let us hear of it , good my friend , said mr dixon .	39.96062347805287
i make no doubt it smacks of wenching .	8.274367025250275
come , be seated , both .	4.156696841416018
’tis as cheap sitting as standing .	4.090559495460017
mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and , expatiating upon his design , told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility , both the inhibitory and the prohibitory , whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired .	23435852970.48308
it grieved him plaguily , he said , to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures , a prey to the vilest bonzes , who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness , sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress , this , he assured them , made his heart weep .	77328745409186.4
to curb this inconvenient ( which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat ), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter , he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder , lord talbot de malahide , a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party .	1822962822.8228042
he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural .	515288272.2978183
money was no object , he said , nor would he take a penny for his pains .	108.7438260185852
the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion , if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions , would find in him their man .	38372.15459856657
for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there , the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose , both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies .	54306473.266945474
after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it .	7973.542711282672
they both , it seems , had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water , as might be observed by mr mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald .	368398.01789290644
his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary’s excepted to it , asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle .	345854.4033179923
mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which , as it dwelt upon his memory , seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi , o quirites , ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach , the buck and doe of the forest glade , the farmyard drake and duck .	224696463809497.84
valuing himself not a little upon his elegance , being indeed a proper man of person , this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced .	11264950.517343108
the young gentleman , his friend , overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him , could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour .	6558.866786832184
mr mulligan , now perceiving the table , asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and , seeing the stranger , he made him a civil bow and said , pray , sir , was you in need of any professional assistance we could give ?	1885040.931694868
who , upon his offer , thanked him very heartily , though preserving his proper distance , and replied that he was come there about a lady , now an inmate of horne’s house , that was in an interesting condition , poor body , from woman’s woe ( and here he fetched a deep sigh ) to know if her happiness had yet taken place .	1627078531.040556
mr dixon , to turn the table , took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence , upon which he rallied him , betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due , as with the noted physician , mr austin meldon , to a wolf in the stomach .	177678377.3525065
for answer mr mulligan , in a gale of laughter at his smalls , smote himself bravely below the diaphragm , exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan ( the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop there’s a belly that never bore a bastard .	23408955.600056022
this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight .	3201.7199510169326
the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber .	249.91346994362243
here the listener who was none other than the scotch student , a little fume of a fellow , blond as tow , congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and , interrupting the narrative at a salient point , having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head ( a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture ) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it .	3.845431777684198e+17
mais bien sûr noble stranger , said he cheerily , et mille compliments .	37.010846787667994
that you may and very opportunely .	4.1260626264688725
there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity .	16.48242248445955
but , gracious heaven , was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well , my god , i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things .	396441857.5128386
with these words he approached the goblet to his lips , took a complacent draught of the cordial , slicked his hair and , opening his bosom , out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband , that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein .	25386271.508245606
gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness , ah , monsieur , he said , had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap ( a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily ) in such an artless disorder , of so melting a tenderness , ’pon my conscience , even you , monsieur , had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever .	94146642675359.14
i declare , i was never so touched in all my life .	28.833294320354238
god , i thank thee , as the author of my days !	18.98564978002205
thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours .	94.1086781350597
a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and , having replaced the locket in his bosom , he wiped his eye and sighed again .	2771.1713081330663
beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures , how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond , the simple swain and the polished coxcomb , the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years .	56192289.39100814
but indeed , sir , i wander from the point .	12.33848050391457

then , though it had poured seven showers , we were neither of us a penny the worse .	252.22723227816087
but beshrew me , he cried , clapping hand to his forehead , tomorrow will be a new day and , thousand thunders , i know of a marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz , from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting .	62542706.57205627
tut , tut !	1.4187722396036229
cries le fécondateur , tripping in , my friend monsieur moore , that most accomplished traveller ( i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town ), is my authority that in cape horn , ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any , even the stoutest cloak .	396954880.9779782

the clumsy things are dear at a sou .	8.242471008022653
one umbrella , were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom , is worth ten such stopgaps .	174.9423148817854
no woman of any wit would wear one .	8.180162059783454
my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for , as she reminded me ( blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies ), dame nature , by the divine blessing , has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb , in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties , is the fittest , nay , the only garment .	658485949895334.0
the first , said she ( and here my pretty philosopher , as i handed her to her tilbury , to fix my attention , gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear ), the first is a bath.. .	714978.6383720392
but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge .	3899.3235242087903
amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and , while all were conjecturing what might be the cause , miss callan entered and , having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon , retired with a profound bow to the company .	7074462.511578007
the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry .	2532307.6081291516
strike me silly , said costello , a low fellow who was fuddled .	48.343434814081235
a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh !	4.0548755920432304
i’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you .	5.79620690039037
what , you dog ?	1.8410750957650015
have you a way with them ?	3.316736390772925
gad’s bud , immensely so , said mr lynch .	9.90724800289704
the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice .	26.848905767468587
demme , does not doctor o’gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin .	47.40021319311719
as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months .	980.3485953263664
lawksamercy , doctor , cried the young blood in the primrose vest , feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body , how you do tease a body !	22309.94464390539
drat the man !	1.417582534506619
bless me , i’m all of a wibbly wobbly .	8.30744055044805
why , you’re as bad as dear little father cantekissem , that you are !	44.380933122072896
may this pot of four half choke me , cried costello , if she aint in the family way .	337.6430062256554
i knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her .	127.67867317479089
the young surgeon , however , rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward .	11692.371731080062
merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy .	63254.02573998265
i want patience , said he , with those who , without wit to enliven or learning to instruct , revile an ennobling profession which , saving the reverence due to the deity , is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth .	785264.0017251857
i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which , so far from being a byword , should be a glorious incentive in the human breast .	665816.5054872282
i cannot away with them .	2.9007481235914394
what ?	1
malign such an one , the amiable miss callan , who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours ?	1021.4533557739069
and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay ?	93.7866692746133
perish the thought !	1.4187705956194252
i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne .	42417.845233861706
having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door .	268.08845955983105
a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado , a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation ( for he swore a round hand ) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath .	7308595242.003199
stap my vitals , said he , them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart .	58586537.35384705
to revert to mr bloom who , after his first entry , had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity .	1168090.1960598838
the young sparks , it is true , were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf .	475810864.14421886
but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity , born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world , which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to , so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin .	474304421539.57983
it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and , being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast , he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and , by intercepting them with the readiest precaution , foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at , rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable .	1109809271948.387
to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy ( a habit of mind which he never did hold with ) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding while for such that , having lost all forbearance , can lose no more , there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat .	126592774878.27765
not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which , caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe , is ever ( as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it ) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions .	7797826373.977571
to conclude , while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was , however , it must be owned , not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being .	186742821.0166405
accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour , saying that , to express his notion of the thing , his opinion ( who ought not perchance to express one ) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers .	8899628373.274742
the dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron .	4157.007639127981
i must acquaint you , said mr crotthers , clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis , old glory allelujurum was round again today , an elderly man with dundrearies , preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina , my life , as he calls her .	54873257.11233519
i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon .	67.06215670463642
’slife , i’ll be round with you .	5.057921605077878
i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her .	444.8479995619258
all fell to praising of it , each after his own fashion , though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap , a clerk in orders , a linkboy ( virtuous ) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household .	66097104.69268773
singular , communed the guest with himself , the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them , that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity , that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest .	9203697793.125336
but , he further added , it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together .	35837.930637832185
but with what fitness , let it be asked of the noble lord , his patron , has this alien , whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights , constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity ?	1108837.47821192
where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled ?	16.140566779221118
during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents ?	12675882.48408449
has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received ?	14.848213893569316
or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is , if report belie him not , his own and his only enjoyer ?	35068.80322116433
far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady , the daughter of a gallant major , or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there ( as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done ) then be it so .	38262306.28794216
unhappy woman , she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate .	15225.966995194693
he says this , a censor of morals , a very pelican in his piety , who did not scruple , oblivious of the ties of nature , to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society !	1228772.2162988514
nay , had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel , it had gone with her as hard as with hagar , the egyptian !	2668.070205811393
in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic .	134526.21686265117
it ill becomes him to preach that gospel .	8.265436080462804
has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare ?	117.86234935380318
a habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life .	60.81539356607357
if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him .	147725.73933549787
his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce .	67.55900879901408
the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which , when rooted in its native orient , throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but , transplanted to a clime more temperate , its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant , acid and inoperative .	534392217595.88165
the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence , who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born .	1125587.6952243906
when he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council , silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates , chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier , broke out at once into a strife of tongues .	2729701046911.142
in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge , to mollify , to refrain .	275.9902997660567
the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent .	1016.1891952827168
every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers , the caesarean section , posthumity with respect to the father and , that rarer form , with respect to the mother , the fratricidal case known as the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused , the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets , miscarriages and infanticides , simulated or dissimulated , the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion , the agnathia of certain chinless chinamen ( cited by mr candidate mulligan ) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that ( as he said ) one ear could hear what the other spoke , the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep , the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein , the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid ( as exemplified in the actual case ) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix , artificial insemination by means of syringes , involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause , the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape , that distressing manner of delivery called by the brandenburghers sturzgeburt the recorded instances of multiseminal , twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents in a word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations .	6.339488663874858e+39
the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest , by her movement , the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning , ardently and ineffectually entertained , to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation .	3252422973645.7393
the abnormalities of harelip , breastmole , supernumerary digits , negro’s inkle , strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded ( the case of madame grissel steevens was not forgotten ) or doghaired infants occasionally born .	11713124.30924341
the hypothesis of a plasmic memory , advanced by the caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for , envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human .	668491.6056927245
an outlandish delegate sustained against both these views , with such heat as almost carried conviction , the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes , his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses .	1962091905.2642868
the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived .	16.488970782630858
it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect , postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man .	1305285.4261629505
contemporaneously , a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other , the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus .	26982874.42061235
hitherto silent , whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice , he delivered briefly and , as some thought , perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has joined .	22523474.523657233
but malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror .	11.686987269989912
he conjured up the scene before them .	5.8516842897979435
the secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared.. .	37.30096370816125
haines !	1
which of us did not feel his flesh creep !	11.416570829260912
he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand , in the other a phial marked poison .	128.2307611417981
surprise , horror , loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin .	271.55481277833894
i anticipated some such reception , he began with an eldritch laugh , for which , it seems , history is to blame .	986.1315280899239
yes , it is true .	2.8205362790532873
i am the murderer of samuel childs .	4.471997683457034
and how i am punished !	2.8378014863603327
the inferno has no terrors for me .	5.795408583983179
this is the appearance is on me .	4.539753674852454
tare and ages , what way would i be resting at all , he muttered thickly , and i tramping dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus ?	357171.34065086
my hell , and ireland’s , is in this life .	13.700257413751212
it is what i tried to obliterate my crime .	11.654639162253389
distractions , rookshooting , the erse language ( he recited some ), laudanum ( he raised the phial to his lips ), camping out .	1865.620221671866
in vain !	1
his spectre stalks me .	2.043974036566657
dope is my only hope.. .	2.8879962306886497
ah !	1
destruction !	1
the black panther !	1.3087127817979052
with a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back .	20.693754620062872
an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said meet me at westland row station at ten past eleven .	750.4529673273377
he was gone .	1.4412019573141823
tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host .	10.907793347732568
the seer raised his hand to heaven , murmuring the vendetta of mananaun !	39.16787241796966
the sage repeated lex talionis .	2.8824446769275722
the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done .	63.167804495184164
malachias , overcome by emotion , ceased .	5.886078328746293
the mystery was unveiled .	2.0414608361305118
haines was the third brother .	2.7895566069992377
his real name was childs .	2.6610632038707935
the black panther was himself the ghost of his own father .	18.806239224277952
he drank drugs to obliterate .	2.9057840260262036
for this relief much thanks .	2.362374956911484
the lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited .	8.296982788292368
no soul will live there .	2.890154666018169
the spider pitches her web in the solitude .	7.646448017583822
the nocturnal rat peers from his hole .	5.811675352981092
a curse is on it .	2.9015443795231404
it is haunted .	1.4435178964393902
murderer’s ground .	1
what is the age of the soul of man ?	8.09983853677842
as she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach , to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast , so too is her age changeable as her mood .	252820.34155144208
no longer is leopold , as he sits there , ruminating , chewing the cud of reminiscence , that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds .	26223.28759981416
a score of years are blown away .	5.304038135948979
he is young leopold .	2.041695576376599
there , as in a retrospective arrangement , a mirror within a mirror ( hey , presto !	131.3303664637223
), he beholdeth himself .	2.0423673106116675
that young figure of then is seen , precociously manly , walking on a nipping morning from the old house in clanbrassil street to the high school , his booksatchel on him bandolierwise , and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf , a mother’s thought .	3402482.932609981
or it is the same figure , a year or so gone over , in his first hard hat ( ah , that was a day !	2014.3368308905951
), already on the road , a fullfledged traveller for the family firm , equipped with an orderbook , a scented handkerchief ( not for show only ), his case of bright trinketware ( alas !	97437.25019684878
a thing now of the past !	3.2271308476189007
) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin , shyly acknowledging ( but the heart ?	21657.09470656239
tell me !	1
) his studied baisemoins .	2.041449039073887
the scent , the smile , but , more than these , the dark eyes and oleaginous address , brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm , seated with jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle ( a meal of noodles , you may be sure , is aheating ), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the europe of a month before .	17010653680.759352
but hey , presto , the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes , shrivels , dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist .	3901.4549906732655
now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons .	43.17785535286867
who can say ?	1.4193193097872956
the wise father knows his own child .	5.320955657165658
he thinks of a drizzling night in hatch street , hard by the bonded stores there , the first .	279.6213004077083
together ( she is a poor waif , a child of shame , yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny ), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university .	1819606.200889581
bridie !	1
bridie kelly !	1
he will never forget the name , ever remember the night first night , the bridenight .	111.8081630390297
they are entwined in nethermost darkness , the willer with the willed , and in an instant fiat !	190.546580341613
light shall flood the world .	2.9161957621141217
did heart leap to heart ?	2.8577022814430126
nay , fair reader .	2.0414558945362384
in a breath ’twas done but hold !	5.6817500662099505
back !	1
it must not be !	2.0081539918614117
in terror the poor girl flees away through the murk .	13.805113864396098
she is the bride of darkness , a daughter of night .	20.26216548136361
she dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day .	11.800524645390745
no , leopold .	1.3870875467105783
name and memory solace thee not .	4.086949855105626
that youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee and in vain .	47.66803965319858
no son of thy loins is by thee .	8.202292700892748
there is none now to be for leopold , what leopold was for rudolph .	62.041352931303294
the voices blend and fuse in clouded silence silence that is the infinite of space and swiftly , silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived .	27354.957634228384
a region where grey twilight ever descends , never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields , shedding her dusk , scattering a perennial dew of stars .	3187.7998201233318
she follows her mother with ungainly steps , a mare leading her fillyfoal .	47.65805466881169
twilight phantoms are they , yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure , slim shapely haunches , a supple tendonous neck , the meek apprehensive skull .	4645.2239220198335
they fade , sad phantoms all is gone .	8.195116709378139
agendath is a waste land , a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa .	63.393521050439325
netaim , the golden , is no more .	7.179522727868807
and on the highway of the clouds they come , muttering thunder of rebellion , the ghosts of beasts .	316.2374222526068
huuh !	1

huuh !	1
parallax stalks behind and goads them , the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions .	78.55118618911646
elk and yak , the bulls of bashan and of babylon , mammoth and mastodon , they come trooping to the sunken sea , lacus mortis .	4048.6913491745454
ominous revengeful zodiacal host !	2.0065072594840547
they moan , passing upon the clouds , horned and capricorned , the trumpeted with the tusked , the lionmaned , the giantantlered , snouter and crawler , rodent , ruminant and pachyderm , all their moving moaning multitude , murderers of the sun .	2530480.2446606304
onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink , unslaked and with horrible gulpings , the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood .	581.7776256875773
and the equine portent grows again , magnified in the deserted heavens , nay to heaven’s own magnitude , till it looms , vast , over the house of virgo .	11040.842796490135
and lo , wonder of metempsychosis , it is she , the everlasting bride , harbinger of the daystar , the bride , ever virgin .	1376.4427980002083
it is she , martha , thou lost one , millicent , the young , the dear , the radiant .	346.03772063903807
how serene does she now arise , a queen among the pleiades , in the penultimate antelucan hour , shod in sandals of bright gold , coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer .	130576.59945387093
it floats , it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams , emerald , sapphire , mauve and heliotrope , sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind , winding , coiling , simply swirling , writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till , after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol , it blazes , alpha , a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of taurus .	12827719282.010572
francis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at school together in conmee’s time .	146.54611325394725
he asked about glaucon , alcibiades , pisistratus .	8.460690620458953
where were they now ?	2.0087839721669516
neither knew .	1
you have spoken of the past and its phantoms , stephen said .	27.55377755431528
why think of them ?	1.8510671931636966
if i call them into life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call ?	450.8447799320676
who supposes it ?	1.4193189937296418
i , bous stephanoumenos , bullockbefriending bard , am lord and giver of their life .	83.75496124079956
he encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves , smiling at vincent .	62.38626166305986
that answer and those leaves , vincent said to him , will adorn you more fitly when something more , and greatly more , than a capful of light odes can call your genius father .	76312.36792032162
all who wish you well hope this for you .	11.608151742634885
all desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate , to acclaim you stephaneforos .	110.01757383776851
i heartily wish you may not fail them .	8.200327395205381
o no , vincent lenehan said , laying a hand on the shoulder near him .	61.92627577278019
have no fear .	1.4425201101237108
he could not leave his mother an orphan .	6.59980562244106
the young man’s face grew dark .	4.085511192751284
all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss .	352.1237834353508
he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart .	100.14878605464644
madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name lenehan as much more .	271.37884111588113
he told them of the race .	3.7566898787066556
the flag fell and , huuh !	3.860867513968945
off , scamper , the mare ran out freshly with o. madden up .	41.249535188739735
she was leading the field .	2.917270439990259
all hearts were beating .	2.041480540779799
even phyllis could not contain herself .	4.087067602978314
she waved her scarf and cried huzzah !	5.258609319347005
sceptre wins !	1
but in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level , reached , outstripped her .	2462.0588738007095
all was lost now .	2.037786940311868
phyllis was silent her eyes were sad anemones .	7.132970274814949
juno , she cried , i am undone .	5.23062100527664
but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook .	1091.3494828897008
a tear fell one only .	2.890759698400777
a whacking fine whip , said lenehan , is w. lane .	21.96398173103235
four winners yesterday and three today .	4.126849411234414
what rider is like him ?	2.847204401286391
mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his .	232.48277059948816
but let us bear it as was the ancient wont .	16.635128772929082
mercy on the luckless !	2.0064562028227146
poor sceptre !	1
he said with a light sigh .	3.316903124918892
she is not the filly that she was .	6.174694937517948
never , by this hand , shall we behold such another .	19.771290060571747
by gad , sir , a queen of them .	7.30092017632455
do you remember her , vincent ?	3.33706157013445
i wish you could have seen my queen today , vincent said .	29.547853488390825
how young she was and radiant ( lalage were scarce fair beside her ) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin , i do not know the right name of it .	21701.90277813701
the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us .	771.4881606455716
in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge .	17721.43115670299
but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close .	4409.973648278124
a week ago she lay ill , four days on the couch , but today she was free , blithe , mocked at peril .	2112.6579265229175
she is more taking then .	2.889258912378367
her posies too !	1.4187703102519145
mad romp that she is , she had pulled her fill as we reclined together .	55.635255542290004
and in your ear , my friend , you will not think who met us as we left the field .	336.5904584261934
conmee himself !	1
he was walking by the hedge , reading , i think a brevier book with , i doubt not , a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page .	34747.355032002415
the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion , feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her .	19882.35729153111
when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries .	123.95667201676241
but he had been kind .	2.02265240308975
in going by he had blessed us .	5.320720902348221
the gods too are ever kind , lenehan said .	11.012495569605258
if i had poor luck with bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely .	207.31588645402383
he was laying his hand upon a winejar malachi saw it and withheld his act , pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label .	1750.9491766162973
warily , malachi whispered , preserve a druid silence .	11.830047085514028
his soul is far away .	2.88734415986443
it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born .	91.50076377204668
any object , intensely regarded , may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods .	306.94220856258136
do you not think it , stephen ?	4.169350049605231
theosophos told me so , stephen answered , whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law .	778.0308889366197
the lords of the moon , theosophos told me , an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation .	234604.15714004275
however , as a matter of fact though , the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character , was not the case at all .	810710.9641387638
the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop .	6622860.775896538
during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burton-on-trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance .	86899194.30588976
he was simply and solely , as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself , which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings , after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf , recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn .	579376759.2585422
eventually , however , both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with , also at the same time , however , a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place .	138411761982531.55
the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life .	148.4970006803944
neither place nor council was lacking in dignity .	8.243110537015452
the debaters were the keenest in the land , the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital .	475.4126847595753
the high hall of horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic .	21496.704741436697
a gallant scene in truth it made .	5.83563311834261
crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb , his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway .	3334.5375022028165
there too , opposite to him , was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom .	559.4054380593199
next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello , the eccentric , while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden .	4677.598336071766
the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan .	4863169.639890253
lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion , while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator , fresh from the hippodrome , and that vigilant wanderer , soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour , but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come .	8422936749764233.0
it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s. dedalus’ ( div .	780.8614807983313
scep .	1
) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods .	187.60672836608072
science , it cannot be too often repeated , deals with tangible phenomena .	47.30445243946076
the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can .	1799.5312305289922
there may be , it is true , some questions which science cannot answer at present such as the first problem submitted by mr l. bloom ( pubb .	4960.544655548932
canv .	1
) regarding the future determination of sex .	5.834029371734072
must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary ( the postmenstrual period , assert others ) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it , as most embryologists incline to opine , such as culpepper , spallanzani , blumenbach , lusk , hertwig , leopold and valenti , a mixture of both ?	17662047508.175755
this would be tantamount to a cooperation ( one of nature’s favourite devices ) between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position , succubitus felix of the passive element .	299121.8532463514
the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality .	60.88297529030557
it is interesting because , as he pertinently remarks , we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways .	1547.1794385198286
mr m. mulligan ( hyg .	2.889024222009874
et eug .	1
doc .	1
) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids , pulmonary complaints etc .	134.15250252073722
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust .	8.233200454122708
these factors , he alleged , and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets , hideous publicity posters , religious ministers of all denominations , mutilated soldiers and sailors , exposed scorbutic cardrivers , the suspended carcases of dead animals , paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas these , he said , were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race .	1108637805.278173
kalipedia , he prophesied , would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life , genuinely good music , agreeable literature , light philosophy , instructive pictures , plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo , artistic coloured photographs of prize babies , all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner .	19643999377.97194
mr j. crotthers ( disc .	2.8890728526675837
bacc .	1
) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect , private or official , culminating in the exposure of newborn infants , the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide .	960311236.8109908
although the former ( we are thinking of neglect ) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative .	146162.02954200696
in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do , all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions .	1029962.5876814311
an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v. lynch ( bacc .	46.69297669050395
arith .	1
) that both natality and mortality , as well as all other phenomena of evolution , tidal movements , lunar phases , blood temperatures , diseases in general , everything , in fine , in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained .	8033141363.896785
still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood ( though other children of the same marriage do not ) must certainly , in the poet’s words , give us pause .	4194438.170173533
nature , we may rest assured , has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence ( modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal ) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development , an arrangement which , though productive of pain to some of our feelings ( notably the maternal ), is nevertheless , some of us think , in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest .	1.0900855397114667e+17
mr s. dedalus’ ( div .	2.3618417070044133
scep .	1
) remark ( or should it be called an interruption ?	16.16036987831992
) that an omnivorous being which can masticate , deglute , digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition , corpulent professional gentlemen , not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns , might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob , reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to .	58779885633.45043
for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being , it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother .	224029413019.23984
in a recent public controversy with mr l. bloom ( pubb .	18.994164109591594

) which took place in the commons’ hall of the national maternity hospital , 29 , 30 and 31 holles street , of which , as is well known , dr a. horne ( lic .	80688.93970088325
in midw .	1
, f. k. q. c. p. i. ) is the able and popular master , he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag ( an esthete’s allusion , presumably , to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes the act of sexual congress ) she must let it out again or give it life , as he phrased it , to save her own .	129314782355.56767
at the risk of her own , was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor , none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered .	15984.599416317611
meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy accouchement .	68.02965280515232
it had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor .	27.06304459132888
all that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped .	94.81760511096488
she had .	1
she had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy .	35.367502692955554
those who have passed on , who have gone before , are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene .	2239.943484034081
reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes , that longing hunger for baby fingers ( a pretty sight it is to see ), in the first bloom of her new motherhood , breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to one above , the universal husband .	17353249.15666171
and as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more , to have her dear doady there with her to share her joy , to lay in his arms that mite of god’s clay , the fruit of their lawful embraces .	2724518.5935462904
he is older now ( you and i may whisper it ) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the ulster bank , college green branch .	1046634.7200855918
o doady , loved one of old , faithful lifemate now , it may never be again , that faroff time of the roses !	1497.5679560681517
with the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days .	27.956303530113182
god !	1
how beautiful now across the mist of years !	8.206179284489403
but their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside , hers and his , charley , mary alice , frederick albert ( if he had lived ), mamy , budgy ( victoria frances ), tom , violet constance louisa , darling little bobsy ( called after our famous hero of the south african war , lord bobs of waterford and candahar ) and now this last pledge of their union , a purefoy if ever there was one , with the true purefoy nose .	2474962498316.65
young hopeful will be christened mortimer edward after the influential third cousin of mr purefoy in the treasury remembrancer’s office , dublin castle .	1569.1822131864462
and so time wags on but father cronion has dealt lightly here .	32.85596494071047
no , let no sigh break from that bosom , dear gentle mina .	47.32651647998675
and doady , knock the ashes from your pipe , the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you ( may it be the distant day !	11546.927517368118
) and dout the light whereby you read in the sacred book for the oil too has run low , and so with a tranquil heart to bed , to rest .	16186.986195772142
he knows and will call in his own good time .	13.617820068254293
you too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man’s part .	38.36146701357555
sir , to you my hand .	4.093420052924332
well done , thou good and faithful servant !	8.112844810456377
there are sins or ( let us call them as the world calls them ) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait .	102863.72948449176
he may suffer their memory to grow dim , let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise .	29831.587695962495
yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances , a vision or a dream , or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast , at midnight , when he is now filled with wine .	391518775.384464
not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath , not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past , silent , remote , reproachful .	1125153.6508250537
the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there , imposed , as it seemed , by habit or some studied trick , upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness , a flair for the cruder things of life .	29732691.665918637
a scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory , evoked , it would seem , by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there ( as some thought ) with their immediate pleasures .	349437.85209366295
a shaven space of lawn one soft may evening , the wellremembered grove of lilacs at roundtown , purple and white , fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop , one by its fellow , with a brief alert shock .	202005013.1023271
and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood , floey , atty , tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in her pose then , our lady of the cherries , a comely brace of them pendent from an ear , bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit .	48745413615.59073
a lad of four or five in linseywoolsey ( blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched ) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands .	984063.6861713318
he frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the piazzetta giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach alles vergängliche in her glad look .	54364810.23323574
mark this farther and remember .	2.917012937149403
the end comes suddenly .	2.0416702567339162
enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces .	67.5308433051863
nothing , as it seems , there of rash or violent .	15.47105209336291
quietude of custody , rather , befitting their station in that house , the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in bethlehem of juda long ago .	19057.689230076747
